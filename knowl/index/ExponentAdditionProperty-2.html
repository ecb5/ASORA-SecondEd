<div class="para"> Applied to polynomials, the rules of differential and integral Calculus are straightforward.  Indeed, differentiating and integrating polynomials represent some of the easiest tasks in a Calculus course.  For example, computing <span class="process-math">\(\int(7-x+x^2)\dx{
x}\)</span> is relatively easy compared to computing <span class="process-math">\(\int\sqrt[3]{1+x^3}\dx{ x}\text{.}\)</span>  Unfortunately, not all functions can be expressed as a polynomial.  For example, <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=\sin x\)</span> cannot be since a polynomial has only finitely many roots and the sine function has infinitely many roots, namely <span class="process-math">\(\{n\pi|\,n\in\ZZ\}\text{.}\)</span>  A standard technique in the 18th century was to write such functions as an “infinite polynomial,” or what today we refer to as a <dfn class="terminology">power series</dfn>.  Unfortunately an “infinite polynomial” is a much more subtle object than a mere polynomial, which by definition is finite.  For now we will not concern ourselves with these subtleties. Instead we will follow the example of our forebears and manipulate all “polynomial–like” objects (finite or infinite) as if they are polynomials.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#ExponentAdditionProperty-2" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
