<div class="para">We are at the edge of very deep mathematical waters and we will only be wading in the shallows. For that reason we will relax the relentless emphasis on rigor we have maintained thus far. Conveying an appreciation for, and an understanding of, the need for rigor has been a primary objective.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#SECTIONLebesgMeas-3-2" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>

<div class="para">Our purpose in this section is to give you a sense of what comes next mathematically but we can’t simultaneously give you a solid, rigorous grounding in <dfn class="terminology">Measure Theory</dfn> and stay within the scope of our text. So, for this section only, we will set rigor (slightly) to the side and instead appeal your intuition by using sketches and only considering positive functions (so that we can safely think of areas). We will also reason by analogy rather than precisely (e.g., using <span class="process-math">\(\delta{}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\eps\)</span>) because our goal here is to give you a sense of how Lesbegue broadened Cauchy’s definition of the integral. In particular we will not develop Lebesgue’s integral in detail. Should you desire a deeper understanding than you’ll get here a second course in Real Analysis is highly recommended.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#SECTIONLebesgMeas-3-3" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>

<div class="para">You may have noticed that we used the term outer measure before. For a measurable set, its measure is this outer measure.  However, there are examples of non–measurable sets.  Any set would have an outer measure, but assigning this as the measure of one of these non–measurable sets results in a number of contradictions on how a measure should behave.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#SECTIONLebesgMeas-3-14" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
