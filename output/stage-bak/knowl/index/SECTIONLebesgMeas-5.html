<div class="para"> That is, as a subset of the reals, the rationals can be contained in a sequence of intervals, the sum of whose lengths can be arbitrarily small.  In a sense this says that a countably infinite set is so small (on the transfinite scale) that it is “almost” finite.  This idea is often expressed with the statement, “<span class="process-math">\(\QQ\)</span> is a set of <em class="emphasis">measure zero</em> in <span class="process-math">\(\RR\text{.}\)</span>” The term “measure” has a precise meaning which we will not pursue.  The following corollary contains the essence of the idea.</div>
