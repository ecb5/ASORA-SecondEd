<div class="para">With the invention of Calculus, mathematicians of the seventeenth century began to use objects which didnâ€™t satisfy the <dfn class="terminology">Archimedean Property</dfn> (in fact, so did Archimedes). As we shall see in the next chapter, when Leibniz wrote the first paper on his version of the Calculus, he followed this practice by explicitly laying out rules for manipulating infinitely small quantities (infinitesimals). These were taken to be actual numbers which are not zero and yet smaller than any real number. The notation he used was <span class="process-math">\(\dx{ x}\)</span> (an infinitely small displacement in the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> direction), and <span class="process-math">\(\dx{ y}\)</span> (an infinitely small displacement in the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> direction). These symbols should look familiar to you. They are the same <span class="process-math">\(\dx{ y}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\dx{ x}\)</span> used to form the derivative symbol <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x}\)</span> that you learned about in Calculus.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#NumbersRealRational-2-52" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">ðŸ”—</a></div>
