<div class="para"> Notice that there is no mention of limits of difference quotients or derivatives.  In fact, the term derivative was not coined until 1797, by Lagrange as we will see in <a href="PowerSeriesQuestions-TaylorsFormula.html" class="internal" title="Section 4.1: Taylorâ€™s Formula">SectionÂ 4.1</a> .  In a sense, these topics were not necessary at the time, as Leibniz and Newton both assumed that the curves they dealt with had tangent lines and, in fact, Leibniz explicitly used the tangent line to relate two differential quantities.  This was consistent with the thinking of the time and for the duration of this chapter we will also assume that all quantities are differentiable.  As we will see later this assumption leads to difficulties.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#NewtonsApproach-10" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">ðŸ”—</a></div>
