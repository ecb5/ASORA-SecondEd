<div class="para">This is what happened in the late nineteenth century.  The real numbers had been used since the Pythagoreans learned that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> was irrational.  But really, most calculuations were (and still are) done with just the rational numbers. Moreover, since <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\)</span> forms a “set of measure zero,”  it is clear that most of the real numbers had gone completely unused.
