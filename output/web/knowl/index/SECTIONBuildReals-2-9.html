<div class="para"> This is what happened in the late nineteenth century.  The real numbers had been used since the Pythagoreans learned that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> was irrational.

Moreover, since <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\)</span> forms a “set of measure zero,” it is clear that most of the real numbers had gone completely unused. The set of real numbers was thus one of those “dark corners” of mathematics. It had to be explored.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#SECTIONBuildReals-2-9" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
