Thus we have necessarily left the history incomplete.  The interested student can fill in the gaps we have left by making use of the extensive resources that can be found at the MacTutor history of mathematics repository.  All of the portraits of mathematicians used in this text have been taken from MacTutor.

  "body": " To the Instructor  The irony of this section is that it exists to tell you that this book was not written for you; it was written for your students. After all, we don't need to teach you about Real Analysis. You already understand the subject. The purpose of this text is to help your students make sense of the formal definitions, theorems, and proofs that they will encounter in your course. We do this by immersing the student in the story of how what is usually called Calculus evolved into modern Real Analysis. Our hope and intention is that this will help the student to appreciate why their intuitive understanding of topics encountered in Calculus needs to be replaced by the formalism of Real Analysis.  The traditional approach to this topic (what we might call the logical story of Real Analysis), starts with a rigorous development of the real number system and uses this to provide rigorous definitions of limits, continuity, derivatives and integrals, and convergence of series; typically in that order. This is a perfectly legitimate story of Real Analysis and, logically, it makes the most sense. Indeed, this is a view of the subject that every mathematician in training should eventually attain. However, it is our contention that your students will appreciate the subject more, and hopefully retain it better, if they see how the subject developed from the intuitive notions of Leibniz, Newton and others in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to the more modern approach developed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. After all, they are coming at it from a viewpoint very similar to that of the mathematicians of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Our goal is to bring them into the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, mathematically speaking.  We hasten to add that this is not a history of analysis book. It is an introductory textbook on Real Analysis which uses the historical context of the subject to frame the concepts and to show why mathematicians felt the need to develop rigorous, non-intuitive definitions to replace their intuitive notions.  You will notice that all of the problems are embedded in the chapters, rather than lumped together at the end of each chapter. This is done to provide a context for the problems which, for the most part, are presented on an as needed basis.  Thus the proofs of nearly all of the theorems appear as problems in the text. Of course, it would be very unfair to ask most students at this level to prove, say, the Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem without some sort of guidance. So in each case we provide an outline of the proof and the subsequent problem will be to use the outline to develop a formal proof. Proof outlines will become less detailed as the students progress. We have found that this approach helps students develop their proof writing skills.  We state in the text, and we encourage you to emphasize to your students, that often they will use the results of problems as tools in subsequent problems. Trained mathematicians do this naturally, but it is our experience that this is still somewhat foreign to students who are accustomed to simply getting the problem done and forgetting about it.   The problems range from the fairly straightforward to the more challenging. Some of them require the use of a computer algebra system (for example, to plot partial sums of a power series). These tend to occur earlier in the book where we encourage the students to use technology to explore the wonders of series. A number of these problems can be done on a sufficiently advanced graphing calculator or even on Wolfram Alpha, so you should assure your students that they do not need to be super programmers to do this. Of course, this is up to you.  One testing strategy we have used successfully is to assign the more time consuming problems as collected homework and to assign other problems as possible test questions. Students were then be given (verbatim) a subset of the latter as an in-class test. Not only does this simplify test creation, it provides the opportunity to ask questions that could not otherwise be reasonably asked in a timed setting. One of the authors has even gone so far as to forgo in class testing entirely, relying instead on weekly hand in assignments for his assessments. If you are shocked by the idea of giving students all of the possible test questions ahead of time, think of how much (re)learning you did while studying the list of possible questions you knew could be asked on a qualifying exam. In our experience there are worse things than having students study by working together on possible test questions beforehand.  In the end, use this book as you see fit. We believe your students will find it readable, as it is intended to be, and we are confident that it will help them to make sense out of the rigorous, non-intuitive definitions and theorems of Real Analysis and help them to develop their proof-writing skills.

Were you able to follow the argument? Probably the step from equation to equation presented no difficulties. But what about the next step? Do you see where equation came from? If so, good for you.

That is, let in equation and see if you can get equation . Do it on that handy pad of paper we told you to get out earlier. Do it now. We ll wait.   If you still haven t gotten out a pad of paper, give up now. You re going to fail this course. Seriously. Do you think we would spend so much time on this, that we would repeat it so many times, if it weren t important. GET OUT A PAD OF PAPER NOW! Last chance. You ve been warned.   Done? Good.  Perhaps you haven t been able to fill in the details on your own. That s ok. Many people can t. If not then get help: from a classmate, a friend, your instructor, whomever. Unfortunately most people won t get help in this situation. Instead they will perceive this as failure, hide it and berate themselves or the problem as stupid. In short they will let their personal insecurities and demons overwhelm them. Don t do this. Get help. You are neither dumb nor incapable. There are a thousand reasons that on any given day you might not be able to solve this problem. But don t let a bad day interfere with the education you are here for. Get someone to help you over this hump. Later you will be able to help your helper in the same way. Really.  At this point we assume that you ve successfully negotiated the transition from equation to equation .  See? It really wasn t that bad after all. Just a lot of elementary algebra. Now that you ve done it (or seen it done), it is easy to see that there really wasn t much there.  But this is the point! We left those computations out precisely because we knew that they were routine and that you could fill in the details. Moreover, filling in the details yourself gives you a little better insight into the computations. If we d filled them in for you we would have robbed you of that insight. And we would have made this book longer than it needs to be. We don t want to do either of those things. If we fill in all of the details of every computation for you, you won t learn to have confidence in your ability to do them yourself. And this book will easily double in length.  So the lesson here is this: Keep that pad of paper handy whenever you are reading this (or any other) mathematics text. You will need it. Routine computations will often be skipped. But calling them routine and skipping them does not mean that they are unimportant. If they were truly unimportant we would leave them out entirely.  Moreover, routine does not mean obvious. Every step we took in the development of the Quadratic Formula was routine. But even routine computations need to be understood and the best way to understand them is to do them. This is the way to learn mathematics; it is the only way that really works. Don t deprive yourself of your mathematics education by skipping the most important parts.   If you didn t fill in those details then you are depriving yourself of the education you are here to obtain. This is sad. There is a good reason for putting these three lessons first. Stop wasting your time and intellect! Go do it now.   As you saw when you filled in the details of our development of the Quadratic Formula the substitution was crucial because it turned into where depends only on , , and . In the sixteenth century a similar technique was used by Ludovico Ferrari (1522-1565) to reduce the general cubic equation into the so-called depressed cubic  where , and depend only on , , , and .  The general depressed cubic had previously been solved by Niccolò Fontana (1500 1557) (usually known as Tartaglia or The Stutterer ) so converting the general cubic into a depressed cubic provided a path for Ferrari to compute the Cubic Formula . (It s like the Quadratic Formula but bigger.)   It is not entirely clear why eliminating the quadratic term should be depressing, but there it is.    Niccolò Fontana, Tartaglia  Portraits Tartaglia  Tartaglia portrait of   Portrait of Tartaglia    Ferrari also knew how to compute the general solution of the depressed quartic so when he and his teacher Girolomo Cardano (1501-1576) figured out how to depress a general quartic they had a complete solution of the general quartic as well.   Girolomo Cardano  Cardano, Girolomo portrait of  Portraits Cardano   Portrait of Cardano    Alas, their methods broke down entirely when they tried to solve the general quintic equation. Unfortunately the rest of this story belongs in a course on Abstract Algebra, not Real Analysis. But the lesson in this story applies to all of mathematics: Every problem solved is a new theorem which then becomes a tool for later use. Depressing a cubic would have been utterly useless had not Tartaglia had a solution of the depressed cubic in hand. The technique they used, with slight modifications, then allowed for a solution of the general quartic as well.  Keep this in mind as you proceed through this course and your mathematical education. Every problem you solve is really a theorem, a potential tool that you can use later. We have chosen the problems in this text deliberately with this in mind. Don t just solve the problems and move on. Just because you have solved a problem does not mean you should stop thinking about it. Keep thinking about the problems you ve solved. Internalize them.

  "title": "Lesson Three",
  "body": " Lesson Three  In the hustle and bustle of a typical college semester, with a lot of demands on your time and very little time to think, it becomes very easy to see each problem you solve as a small, isolated victory and then move on to the next challenge. This is understandable. Each problem you solve is a small victory and you ve every right to be proud of it. But it is not isolated and it is a mistake to think that it is.  In his book How to Solve It the mathematician and teacher George Polya (1887 1985) gave four steps for problem solving. The steps may be paraphrased as   Understand the problem.    Formulate a plan.    Execute the plan.    Reflect on what you ve done.      George Polya  Portraits Polya  Polya, George portrait of      This process is iterative. That is, once a plan is formulated and executed we often find that our plan was not up to the task. So we have to ask what went wrong, form a new plan and try again. This is the fourth step: Reflect on what you ve done.  Almost everyone remembers this fourth step when their plan doesn t work. After all, you ve got to try again so you have to ask what went wrong. But it is all too easy to neglect that crucial fourth step when the plan succeeds. In that case, flush with success we usually move on to the next problem and start over from scratch.  This is a mistake. Having solved a problem is no reason to stop thinking about it.  That fourth step is at least as important when we have succeeded as when we have failed. Each time you solve a problem stop and ask yourself a few questions:   Are there any easy consequences that follow from the result?    How does it fit into the broader scheme of other problems you have solved?    How might it be used in the future?     Also, notice the structure of the problem. Some assumptions had to be made. What were they? Were they all necessary? That is, did your solution use everything that was assumed? If not, you may have something considerably more general than it at first appears to be. What is that more general statement? Even if you used all of the assumptions, was that really necessary? Can you solve a similar problem with weaker assumptions?  Take a moment to pack all of these questions (and their answers) away in your mind so that when you see something similar in the future you will be reminded of it. Don t solve any problem and then forget it and move on. The nature of mathematics is cumulative. Remember, you are not here to accumulate grade points. You are here to learn and understand the concepts and methods of mathematics, to gain mathematical maturity. Part of that maturation process is the accumulation of a body of facts (theorems), and techniques that can be used to prove new theorems (solve new problems).  This text has been written with the maturation process in mind. You will frequently find that the problems you solve today can be used to good effect in the ones you attempt tomorrow, but only if you remember them. So take a moment after you ve solved each problem to think about how it fits into the patterns you already know. This is important enough to bear repeating: A problem, once solved, becomes a tool for solving subsequent problems!   The purpose of the following sequence of problems is to help you become accustomed to this notion (if you aren t already). It is a progression of results about prime numbers. As you probably recall, a prime number is any integer greater than whose only factors are itself and . For example, , , , , are prime, while , , are not. A major result about prime numbers is the following:   The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic   Any integer greater than is either prime or it is a product of prime numbers. Furthermore, this prime decomposition is unique up to the order of the factors.    We will not prove this, but we will use it as a starting point to examine the following problems. As you do these problems, notice how subsequent problems make use of the previous results.  Notice that the notation simply means that the integer divides the integer with no remainder.   Fermat s Little Theorem, step 1  Fermat s Little Theorem problems leading to if a prime divides a product of two numbers then it divides one of the factors   Let be a prime number and positive integers such that . Show that or .    If then we are done. If not then notice that is a prime factor of .

To get from to , use the binomial theorem on .     Fermat s Little Theorem  Fermat s Little Theorem   If is a prime number then for all positive integers .     Fermat s Little Theorem is the foundational basis for a number of results in number theory and encryption.    Recall what we said above: Having solved a problem is no reason to stop thinking about it. Reflect upon your proof of Fermat s Little Theorem by answering these questions.     Will the result of Fermat s Little Theorem hold if is not a prime number?      If not, then which of the steps in the proof breaks down?     "

  "body": " Numbers, Real and Rational  The set of real numbers (denoted, ) is badly named. The real numbers are no more or less real in the non-mathematical sense that they exist than any other set of numbers, just like the set of rational numbers ( ), the set of integers ( ), or the set of natural numbers ( ). The name real numbers is (almost) an historical anomaly not unlike the name Pythagorean Theorem which was actually known and understood long before Pythagoras lived.  When Calculus was being invented in the th century, numbers were thoroughly understood, or so it was believed.   Some would say re-invented. See , or .     They were, after all, just numbers. Combine them. We call that addition. If you add them repeatedly we call it multiplication. Subtraction and division were similarly understood.  It was (and still is) useful to visualize these things in a more concrete way. If we take a stick of length 2 and another of length 3 and lay them end-to-end we get a length of 5. This is addition. If we lay them end to end but at right angles then our two sticks are the length and width of a rectangle whose area is 6. This is multiplication.  Of course measuring lengths with whole numbers has limitations, but these are not hard to fix. If we have a length (stick) of length 1 and another of length 2, then we can find another whose length when compared to 1 is the same (has the same proportion) as is to . That number of course, is .      Three straight lines of lengths 1\/2, 1, and 2, and so labeled.    Notice how fraction notation reflects the operation of comparing 1 to 2. This comparison is usually referred to as the ratio of to so numbers of this sort are called rational numbers. The set of rational numbers is denoted for quotients. In grade school they were introduced to you as fractions. Once fractions are understood, this visualization using line segments (sticks) leads quite naturally to their representation with the rational number line.   The Rational Number Line   The segment of the rational number line between negative 1.4 and positive 1.4.    This seems to work as a visualization because the rational numbers and the points on a line seem to share certain properties. Chief among these is that between any two points on the rational line there is another point, just as between any two rational numbers there is another rational number.   rational numbers exist between rational numbers   Let and find a rational number between and .    This is all very clean and satisfying until we examine it just a bit closer. Then it becomes quite mysterious. Consider again the rational numbers and . If we think of these as lengths we can ask, \"Is there a third length, say , such that we can divide into pieces, each of length  and also divide into pieces each of length \" A few minutes thought should convince you that this is the same as the problem of finding a common denominator so will work nicely. (Confirm this yourself.)  You may be wondering what we re making all of this fuss about. Obviously this is always true. In fact the previous paragraph gives an outline of a very nice little proof of this. Here are the theorem and its proof presented formally.   common denominators   Suppose , , , and are integers, with . There is a number such that and where and are also integers.     To prove this theorem we will display , and . It is your responsibility to confirm that these actually work. Here they are: , , and .    common denominators   Confirm that as given in the proof of satisfy the requirements of the theorem.           suggests the following very deep and important question: Are there lengths which can not be expressed as the ratio of two integer lengths? The answer, of course, is yes. Otherwise we wouldn t have asked the question.    One of the best known examples of such a number is the circumference of a circle with diameter 1. This is the number usually denoted by . But circles are extremely complex objects they only seem simple because they are so familiar. Arising as it does from a circle, you would expect the number to be very complex as well and this is true. In fact is an exceptionally weird number for a variety of reasons. Let s start with something a little easier to think about.   is irrational Squares are simple. Two sets of parallel lines at right angles, all of the same length. What could be simpler? If we construct a square with sides having length 1 then its diagonal has length .   A construction of      This is a number which cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers. That is, it is irrational . This has been known since ancient times, but it is still quite disconcerting when first encountered. It seems so counter intuitive that the intellect rebels. This can t be right, it says. That s just crazy!   Nevertheless it is true and we can prove it is true as follows.  What happens if we suppose that the square root of two can be expressed as a ratio of integers? We will show that this leads irrevocably to a conclusion that is manifestly not true.  Suppose where and are integers. Suppose further that the fraction is in lowest terms. This assumption is crucial because if is in lowest terms we know that at most only one of them is even.   So .  Therefore is also even and so must be even too. But this is impossible. We ve just concluded that and are both even and this conclusion follows directly from our initial assumption that at most one of them could be even.  This is nonsense. Where is our error? It is not in any single step of our reasoning. That was all solid. Check it again to be sure.  Therefore our error must be in the initial assumption that could be expressed as a fraction. That assumption must therefore be false. In other words, cannot be so expressed.  Irrational Numbers  irrational numbers drill, 5 parts   Show that each of the following numbers is irrational:                                  The square root of every positive integer which is not the square of an integer.      sums and products of rational and irrational numbers   Determine if each of the following is always rational or always irrational. Justify your answers.     The sum of two rational numbers.      The sum of two irrational numbers.      The sum of a rational and an irrational number.      creating irrationals from rationals  creating rationals from irrationals  irrational numbers    Decide if it is possible to have two rational numbers, and , such that is irrational. If so, display an example of such and . If not, prove that it is not possible.      Decide if it is possible to have two irrational numbers, and , such that is rational. If so, display an example of such and . If not, prove that it is not possible.    The number must be either rational or irrational (why?). What can you conclude in each case?      meaning of The fact that is not rational is cute and interesting but unless, like the Pythagoreans of ancient Greece, you have a strongly held religious conviction that all numbers are rational, it does not seem terribly important. On the other hand, the very existence of raises some interesting questions. For example what can the symbol possibly mean? If the exponent were a rational number, say with , then clearly . But since for any integers and how do we interpret Does it have any meaning at all? The more you think about this, the more puzzling the existence of irrational numbers becomes. Suppose for example we reconsider the construction of a line segment of length . It is clear that the construction works and that we really can build such a line segment. It exists.  Repeat the construction but this time let s put the base side on the rational line.         We know that the diagonal of this square is as indicated. And we know that is not a rational number.  Now leave the diagonal pinned at but allow it to rotate down so that it coincides with the axis.      A one by one square drawn with one corner at the origin and it's diagonally opposite corner at (1,1). It's diagonal is label the square root of two, and is free to swing down onto the x axis while the point at (0,0) remains where it is.    The end of our diagonal will trace out an arc of the circle with radius . When the diagonal coincides with the axis, its endpoint will obviously be the point as shown.  But wait! We re using the rational number line for our axis. That means the only points on the axis are those that correspond to rational numbers (fractions). But we know that is not rational! Conclusion: There is no point . It simply doesn t exist.  Put differently, there is a hole in the rational number line right where should be.         This is weird, but it s even worse than that!  Recall that between any two rational numbers there is always another. This fact is what led us to represent the rational numbers with a line in the first place.  It s straightforward to show that , , etc. are all irrational too. So are and , though they aren t as easy to show. It seems that the rational line has a bunch of holes in it. Infinitely many.  And yet, the following theorem is true   real numbers exist between real numbers      Between any two distinct real numbers there is a rational number.    Between any two distinct real numbers there is an irrational number.       Both parts of this theorem rely on a judicious use of what is now called the Archimedean Property of the Real Number System, which can be formally stated as follows.   The Archimedean Property    Archimedean Property Given any two positive real numbers, and , there is a positive integer, such that .         Physically this says that we can empty an ocean with a teaspoon , provided we are willing to use the teaspoon a large number of times .  This is such an intuitively straightforward concept that it is easy to accept it without proof. Until the invention of Calculus, and even for some time after that, it was simply assumed. However as the foundational problems posed by the concepts of Calculus were understood and solved we were eventually led to a deeper understanding of the complexities of the real number system and the Archimedean Property is no longer taken as an unproved axiom. Rather, it is now understood to be a consequence of other axioms. We will prove this in , but for now we will accept it as obviously true just as Archimedes did.   Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm and infinitesimals With the invention of Calculus, mathematicians of the seventeenth century began to use objects which didn t satisfy the Archimedean Property (in fact, so did Archimedes). As we shall see in the next chapter, when Leibniz wrote the first paper on his version of the Calculus, he followed this practice by explicitly laying out rules for manipulating infinitely small quantities (infinitesimals). These were taken to be actual numbers which are not zero and yet smaller than any real number. The notation he used was (an infinitely small displacement in the direction), and (an infinitely small displacement in the direction). These symbols should look familiar to you. They are the same and used to form the derivative symbol that you learned about in Calculus.  Mathematicians of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries made amazing scientific and mathematical progress exploiting these infinitesimals, even though they were foundationally suspect. No matter how many times you add the infinitesimal to itself the result will not be bigger than, say , which is very bizarre.   Lagrange, Joseph-Louis When foundational issues came to the forefront, infinitesimals fell somewhat out of favor. You probably didn t use them very much in Calculus. Most of the time you probably used the prime notation, introduced by Lagrange in the eighteenth century. Some of the themes in this book are: Why differentials fell out of favor, what were they replaced with and how the modern notations you learned in Calculus evolved over time.  To conclude this aside on the Archimedean Property , the idea of infinitesimals was revisited in the twentieth century by the logician Abraham Robinson in . Robinson was able to put the idea of infinitesimals on a solid logical foundation. But in the 18th century, the existence of infinitesimal numbers was shaky to say the very least. However this did not prevent mathematicians from successfully exploiting these infinitely small quantities.  We will come back to this saga in later chapters, but for now we return to .   Sketch of Proof  We will outline the proof of part (a) of and indicate how it can be used to prove part b.  Let and be real numbers with . There are two cases.   Case 1:   . In this case there is at least one integer between and . Since integers are rational we are done.    Case 2:   . In this case, by the Archimedean Property there is a positive integer, say , such that . Now there will be an integer between and . You should now be able to find a rational number between and .      For part (b), divide and by any positive irrational number and apply part a. There are a couple of details to keep in mind. These are considered in the following problem.   products of rationals and irrationals    Prove that the product of a nonzero rational number and an irrational number is irrational.      Use the result of part (a) to prove .     As a practical matter, the existence of irrational numbers isn t really very important. In light of , any irrational number can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a rational number. So if we re designing a bridge and is needed we just use instead. The error introduced is less than so it probably doesn t matter.  But from a theoretical point of view this is devastating. When Calculus was invented, the rational numbers were suddenly not up to the task of justifying the concepts and operations we needed to work with.   Newton, Isaac foundation of Calculus Newton explicitly founded his version of Calculus on the assumption that we can think of variable quantities as being generated by a continuous motion. If our number system has holes in it such continuous motion is impossible because we have no way to jump over the gaps. So Newton simply postulated that there were no holes. He filled in the hole where should be. He simply said, yes there is a number there called and he did the same with all of the other holes.  To be sure there is no record of Newton explicitly saying, Here s how I m going to fill in the holes in the rational number line. Along with everyone else at the time, he simply assumed there were no holes and moved on. It took about years of puzzling and arguing over the contradictions, anomalies and paradoxes to work out the consequences of that apparently simple assumption. The task may not yet be fully accomplished, but by the 20th century the properties of the real number system ( ) as an extension of the rational number system ( ) were well understood. Here are both systems visualized as lines:      and       Impressive, no?  The reason they look alike, except for the labels and of course, is that our ability to draw sketches of the objects we re studying utterly fails when we try to sketch , as different from . All of the holes in really are there, but the non-holes are packed together so closely that we can t separate them in a drawing. This inability to sketch the objects we study will be a frequent source of frustration.  Of course, this will not stop us from drawing sketches. When we do, our imaginations will save us because it is possible to imagine as distinct from . But put away the idea that a sketch is an accurate representation of anything. At best our sketches will only be aids to the imagination.  So, at this point we will simply assume the existence of the real numbers. We will assume also that they have all of the properties that we are used to. This is perfectly acceptable as long as we make our assumptions explicit. However we need to be aware that, so far, the existence and properties of the real numbers is an assumption that has not been logically derived. Any time we make an assumption we need to be prepared to either abandon it completely if we find that it leads to nonsensical results, or to re-examine the assumption in the light of these results to see if we can find another assumption that subsumes the first and explains the (apparently) nonsensical results.

  "body": " Newton and Leibniz Get Started   Leibniz Calculus Rules   Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm first Calculus publication The rules for Calculus were first laid out in the 1684 paper Nova methodus pro maximis et minimis, itemque tangentibus, quae nec fractas nec irrationales, quantitates moratur, et singulare pro illi calculi genus (A New Method for Maxima and Minima as Well as Tangents, Which is Impeded Neither by Fractional Nor by Irrational Quantities, and a Remarkable Type of Calculus for This) written by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646 1716). Leibniz started with subtraction. That is, if and are very close together then their difference, , is very small. He expanded this idea to say that if and are infinitely close together (but still distinct) then their difference , is infinitesimally small (but not zero).   Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz  Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm portrait of  Portraits Leibniz   Portrait of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz      Calculus Differentialis   This translates, loosely, as the Calculus of Differences .   This idea is logically very suspect and Leibniz knew it. But he also knew that when he used his calculus differentialis he was getting correct answers to some very hard problems. So he persevered.  Leibniz called both and differentials (Latin for difference) because he thought of them as, essentially, the same thing. Over time it has become customary to refer to the infinitesimal as a differential, and to reserve the word difference and the notation for the finite case. This is why Calculus is often called Differential Calculus .  In his paper Leibniz gave rules for dealing with these infinitely small differentials. Specifically, given a variable quantity , represented an infinitesimal change in . Differentials are related via the slope of the tangent line to a curve. That is, if , then and are related by .  Leibniz then divided by giving    Newton, Isaac The elegant and expressive notation Leibniz invented was so useful that it has been retained through the years despite some profound changes in the underlying concepts. For example, Leibniz and his contemporaries would have viewed the symbol as an actual quotient of infinitesimals, whereas today we define it via the limit concept first suggested by Newton.   Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm differentiation rules As a result Leibniz rules governing his differentials are very modern in appearance: .  Leibniz states these rules without proof: . . . the demonstration of all this will be easy to one who is experienced in such matters . . . . Mathematicians in Leibniz s day would have been expected to understand intuitively that if is a constant, then . Likewise, is really an extension of .    Leibniz s Approach to the Product Rule   Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm The explanation of the product rule using differentials is a bit more involved, but Leibniz expected that mathematicans would be fluent enough to derive it. The product can be thought of as the area of the following rectangle         With this in mind, can be thought of as the change in area when is changed by and is changed by . This can be seen as the L shaped region in the following drawing.           By dividing the L shaped region into 3 rectangles we obtain .  Even though and are infinitely small, Leibniz reasoned that is even more infinitely small (quadratically infinitely small?) compared to and and can thus be ignored leaving .   Newton, Isaac You should feel some discomfort at the idea of simply tossing the product aside because it is comparatively small. This means you have been well trained, and have thoroughly internalized Newton s dictum : The smallest errors may not, in mathematical matters, be scorned. It is logically untenable to toss aside an expression just because it is small. Even less so should we be willing to ignore an expression on the grounds that it is infinitely smaller than another quantity which is itself infinitely small.   Newton and Leibniz both knew this as well as we do. But they also knew that their methods worked. They gave verifiably correct answers to problems which had, heretofore, been completely intractable. It is the mark of their genius that both men persevered in spite of the very evident difficulties their methods entailed.    Newton s Approach to the Product Rule   Isaac Newton s (1643 1727) approach to Calculus his Method of Fluxions  depended fundamentally on motion. He conceived of variables (fluents) as changing (flowing or fluxing) in time. The rate of change of a fluent he called a fluxion. As a theoretical foundation both Leibniz s and Newton s approaches have fallen out of favor, although both are still universally used as a conceptual approach, a way of thinking, about the ideas of Calculus.     Isaac Newton  Newton, Isaac portrait of  Portraits Newton   Bust of Isaac Newton    In Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica (this is usually shortened to Principia ) Newton proved the Product Rule as follows: Let and be flowing quantites and consider the rectangle, , whose sides are and . is also a flowing quantity and we wish to find its fluxion (derivative) at any time.                  First we increment and by the half increments and respectively. Then the corresponding half increment of is .  Now decrement and by the same amounts: .  Subtracting equation from equation gives which is the total change of over the intervals and and also recognizably the Product Rule.  This argument is no better than Leibniz s as it relies heavily on the number to make it work. If we take any other increments in and whose total lengths are and it will simply not work. Try it and see.  In Newton s defense, he wasn t really trying to justify his mathematical methods in the Principia . His attention was on physics, not math, so he was really just trying to give a convincing demonstration of his methods. You may decide for yourself how convincing his demonstration is.   Lagrange, Joseph-Louis Notice that there is no mention of limits of difference quotients or derivatives. In fact, the term derivative was not coined until 1797, by Lagrange as we will see in . In a sense, these topics were not necessary at the time, as Leibniz and Newton both assumed that the curves they dealt with had tangent lines and, in fact, Leibniz explicitly used the tangent line to relate two differential quantities. This was consistent with the thinking of the time and for the duration of this chapter we will also assume that all quantities are differentiable. As we will see later this assumption leads to difficulties.  Both Newton and Leibniz were satisfied that their Calculus provided answers that agreed with what was known at the time.

Willebrord Snell (1580 1626)   Portrait of Willebrord Snell    Given that light travels through air at a speed of and travels through water at a speed of the problem is to find the fastest path from point to point .           According to Fermat s Principle of Least Time , this fastest path is the one that light will travel.  Using the fact that and the labeling in the picture below we can obtain a formula for the time it takes for light to travel from to .            Using the rules of Leibniz s Calculus, we obtain .  Using the fact that at the minimum value for , , we see that the fastest path from to must satisfy .         From we see that the path that light travels must satisfy which is Snell s Law.   Bernoulli, Johann   Brachistochrone problem, the To compare 18th century and modern techniques we will consider Johann Bernoulli s (1667 1748) solution of the Brachistochrone Problem . In 1696, Bernoulli posed and solved, the Brachistochrone problem: To find the shape of a frictionless wire joining points and so that the time it takes for a bead to slide down under the force of gravity is as small as possible.          Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli s challenge Bernoulli posed this path of fastest descent problem to challenge the mathematicians of Europe and used his solution to demonstrate the power of Leibniz Calculus as well as his own ingenuity.   I, Johann Bernoulli, address the most brilliant mathematicians in the world. Nothing is more attractive to intelligent people than an honest, challenging problem, whose possible solution will bestow fame and remain as a lasting monument. Following the example set by Pascal, Fermat, etc., I hope to gain the gratitude of the whole scientific community by placing before the finest mathematicians of our time a problem which will test their methods and the strength of their intellect. If someone communicates to me the solution of the proposed problem, I shall publicly declare him worthy of praise.     Johann Bernoulli  Bernoulli, Johann portrait of  Portraits Johann Bernoulli   Portrait of Johann Bernoulli     Bernoulli, Jacob  Newton, Isaac In addition to Johann s, solutions were obtained from Newton, Leibniz, Johann s brother Jacob Bernoulli, and the Marquis de l Hopital . At the time there was an ongoing and very vitriolic controversy raging over whether Newton or Leibniz had been the first to invent Calculus. As an advocate for Leibniz, Bernoulli did not believe Newton would be able to solve the problem using his fluxions. So Bernoulli s this challenge was in part an attempt to embarrass Newton. However Newton solved it easily.  At this point in his life Newton had all but quit science and mathematics and was fully focused on his administrative duties as Master of the Mint. Due in part to rampant counterfeiting, England s money had become severely devalued and the nation was on the verge of economic collapse. The solution was to recall all of the existing coins, melt them down, and strike new ones. As Master of the Mint this job fell to Newton . As you might imagine this was a rather Herculean task. Nevertheless, according to his niece (and housekeeper):   When the problem in 1696 was sent by Bernoulli Sir I.N. was in the midst of the hurry of the great recoinage and did not come home till four from the Tower very much tired, but did not sleep till he had solved it, which was by four in the morning.   He is reported to have complained, I do not love . . . to be . . . teezed by forreigners about Mathematical things  .  Newton submitted his solution anonymously, presumably to avoid more controversy. Nevertheless the methods he used were so distinctively Newton s that Bernoulli is said to have exclaimed Tanquam ex ungue leonem .    Translation: Tanquam ex ungue leonem    I know the lion by his claw.     Brachistochrone problem, the Bernoulli s solution Newton s solution was clever but it doesn t provide any insights we ll be interested in so we will focus on Bernoulli s ingenious solution which starts, interestingly enough, with Snell s Law of Refraction. He begins by considering the stratified medium in the following figure, where an object travels with velocities in the various layers.         By repeatedly applying Snell s Law he concluded that the fastest path must satisfy .  In other words, the ratio of the sine of the angle that the curve makes with the vertical and the speed remains constant along this fastest path.  If we think of a continuously changing medium as stratified into infinitesimal layers and extend Snell s law to an object whose speed is constantly changing, then along the fastest path, the ratio of the sine of the angle that the curve s tangent makes with the vertical, , and the speed, , must remain constant, as in below.         If we include the horizontal and vertical axes and let denote the position of the bead at a particular time then we have the following picture.         In , denotes the length that the bead has traveled down to point (that is, the arc length of the curve from the origin to that point) and denotes the tangential component of the acceleration due to gravity . Since acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time we see that .  To get a sense of how physical problems were approached using Leibniz s Calculus we will use the above equation to show that .  By similar triangles we have . As a student of Leibniz, Bernoulli would have regarded as a fraction so and since acceleration is the rate of change of velocity we have . In the seventeenth, eighteenth, and even well into the nineteenth centuries, European mathematicians regarded , and as infinitesimally small numbers which nevertheless obey all of the usual rules of algebra. Thus they would simply rearrange equation , to get . Since is the rate of change of position with respect to time it is, in fact, the velocity of the bead. That is . Bernoulli would have interpreted this as a statement that two rectangles of height and , with respective widths and have equal area. Summing (integrating) all such rectangles we g et: or .  You are undoubtedly uncomfortable with the cavalier manipulation of infinitesimal quantities you ve just witnessed, so we ll pause for a moment now to compare a modern development of equation to Bernoulli s. As before we begin with the equation: as before.   Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm In effect, in the modern formulation we have traded the simplicity and elegance of differentials for a comparatively cumbersome repeated use of the Chain Rule. No doubt you noticed when taking Calculus that in the differential notation of Leibniz, the Chain Rule looks like we are simply canceling a factor in the top and bottom of a fraction: . This is because for 18th century mathematicians, that is exactly what it was, and Leibniz designed his notation to reflect that viewpoint.  To put it another way, 18th century mathematicians wouldn t have recognized a need for what we call the Chain Rule because this operation was a triviality for them. Just reduce the fraction. This begs the question: Why did we abandon such a clear and simple interpretation of our symbols in favor of the comparatively more cumbersome modern interpretation? This is one of the questions we will try to answer in this course.  Returning to the Brachistochrone problem we observe that .  Bernoulli was then able to solve this differential equation.   Brachistochrone problem, the   Show that the equations satisfy equation equation . Bernoulli recognized this solution to be an inverted cycloid, the curve traced by a fixed point on a circle as the circle rolls along a horizontal surface.    This illustrates the state of Calculus in the late 1600s and early 1700s; the foundations of the subject were a bit shaky but there was no denying its power.   "

  "title": "Power Series as Infinite Polynomials",
  "body": " Power Series as Infinite Polynomials   polynomials infinite Applied to polynomials, the rules of differential and integral Calculus are straightforward. Indeed, differentiating and integrating polynomials represent some of the easiest tasks in a Calculus course. For example, computing is relatively easy compared to computing . Unfortunately, not all functions can be expressed as a polynomial. For example, cannot be since a polynomial has only finitely many roots and the sine function has infinitely many roots, namely . A standard technique in the 18th century was to write such functions as an infinite polynomial, or what today we refer to as a power series . Unfortunately an infinite polynomial is a much more subtle object than a mere polynomial, which by definition is finite. For now we will not concern ourselves with these subtleties. Instead we will follow the example of our forebears and manipulate all polynomial like objects (finite or infinite) as if they are polynomials.   power series definition  Definition power series   A power series centered at is a series of the form .    Thus a power series centered around zero has the form . In this section we will focus on power series centered around zero. In the next section we will look at power series centered about points other than zero. .   A useful comment on notation:  The most advantageous way to represent a power series is using summation notation since there can be no doubt about the pattern in the terms. After all, this notation contains a formula for the general term. However, there are instances where summation notation is not practical. In these cases, it is acceptable to indicate the sum by supplying the first few terms and using ellipses (the three dots). If this is done, then enough terms must be included to make the pattern clear to the reader.    series Geometric series naive derivation Returning to our definition of a power series, consider the power series . If we multiply this power series by , we obtain   Dividing by gives us the power series representation , which is known as the Geometric Series .  For each value of a power series reduces to a different ordinary (numerical) series . For example, if we substitute into the left side of equation , we obtain the (numerical) series  But substituting into the right side yields   If these computations are valid then it must be that , which seems weird, but you can verify it by entering into any calculator.  If , then subtracting from both sides and multiplying by gives which has probably come up on your calculator more than once. But what seems wierder still is that if we multiply by again we get , which seems like nonsense. It simply can t be true, can it? What do you think? Is or that just nonsense? Either way it is clear that the real numbers hide deeper mysteries than the irrationality of .  There are other issues with these formal manipulations too. Substituting or into equation yields the questionable results .   When we say formal manipulations we mean that we will perform purely algebraic operations on an given expression without concerning ourselves (much) about whether the operations make sense in context. We will formalize them in    A power series representation of our function seems to work in some cases, but not in others. Obviously we are missing something important here, though it may not be clear exactly what. For now, we will continue to follow the example of our 18th century predecessors. That is, for the rest of this section we will use formal manipulations to obtain and use power series representations of various functions. Keep in mind that this is all highly suspect until we can resolve problems like those we ve just seen.  Power series became an important tool in analysis in the 1700s. By representing various functions as power series they could be dealt with as if they were (infinite) polynomials. The following is an example.   as the solution of an Initial Value Problem   Solve the following Initial Value problem: Find given that    A few seconds of thought should convince you that the solution of this problem is . We will ignore this for now in favor of emphasising the technique.   Assuming the solution can be expressed as a power series we have .  Differentiating gives us .  Since we see that .  This leads to the relationship .  Thus the power series solution of the differential equation is .  Using the initial condition , we get . Thus the solution to the initial problem is . Let s call this function . Then by definition .    Let s examine some properties of this function. The first property is clear from the definition.   Property 1 .    Property 2 . .  To see this we multiply the two series together, so we have so that, finally .   Property 3 . If is a positive integer then . In particular, .    Prove Property 3.     Property 4 . .

Prove Property 6.     definition  Definition   Let be denoted by the number . Using the power series , we can approximate to any degree of accuracy. In particular .    In light of Property 6, we see that for any rational number , . Not only does this give us the power series representation for any rational number , but it gives us a way to define for irrational values of as well. That is, we can define for any real number .  As an illustration, we now have . The expression is meaningless if we try to interpret it as one irrational number raised to another. What does it mean to raise anything to the power? However the power series does seem to have meaning and it can be used to extend the exponential function to irrational exponents. In fact, defining the exponential function via this power series answers the question we raised in : What does mean? It means .  This may seem to be the long way around just to define something as simple as exponentiation. But that is a fundamentally misguided attitude. Exponentiation only seems simple because we ve always thought of it as repeated multiplication (in ) or root taking (in ). When we expand the operation to the real numbers this simply can t be the way we interpret something like . How do you take the product of copies of The concept is meaningless. What we need is an interpretation of which is consistent with, say . This is exactly what the power series representation of provides.  We also have a means of computing integrals as power series. For example, the famous bell shaped curve given by the function is of vital importance in statistics as it must be integrated to calculate probabilities. The power series we developed gives us a method of integrating this function. For example, we have .  This power series can be used to approximate the integral to any degree of accuracy.    Write as a power series expanded about and use your series to represent as a power series.      Let . Find a power series expansion about 0 for           series solutions of   The ability to express complex functions as power series ( infinite polynomials ) became a tool of paramount importance for solving differential equations in the 1700s.

(This shows that there may be more than one way to obtain a power series representation.)     Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm The power series for arctangent was known by James Gregory (1638-1675) and it is sometimes referred to as Gregory s series. Leibniz independently discovered by examining the area of a circle. Though it gives us a means for approximating to any desired accuracy, the power series converges too slowly to be of any practical use. For example, if we compute the sum of the first terms we get which only approximates to two decimal places.   James Gregory  Portraits Gregory  Gregory, James portrait of   Portrait of James Gregory     Newton, Isaac Newton knew of these results and the general scheme of using power series to compute areas under curves. He used these results to provide a power series approximation for as well, which, hopefully, would converge faster. We will use modern terminology to streamline Newton s ideas. First notice that as this integral gives the area of one quarter of the unit circle, . The trick now is to find a power series that represents .  To this end we start with the binomial theorem , where .  Unfortunately, we now have a small problem with our notation which will be a source of confusion later if we don t fix it. So we will pause to address this matter. We will come back to the binomial expansion afterward.  This last expression is becoming awkward in much the same way that an expression like is awkward. Just as this sum is less cumbersome when written as the product  is less cumbersome when we write it as .  A capital pi is used to denote a product in the same way that a capital sigma is used to denote a sum. The most familiar example would be writing .  Just as it is convenient to define , we will find it convenient to define . Similarly, the fact that leads to the convention . Strange as this may look, it is convenient and is consistent with the convention .  Returning to the binomial expansion and recalling our convention , we can write, .  These two representations probably look the same at first. Take a moment and be sure you see where they differ.  There is an advantage to using this convention (especially when programing a product into a computer), but this is not a deep mathematical insight. It is just a notational convenience and we don t want you to fret over it, so we will use both formulations (at least initially).  Notice that we can extend the above definition of to values . In this case, will equal 0 as one of the factors in the product will be (the one where ). This gives us that when and so holds true for any nonnegative integer . Essentially Newton asked if it could be possible that the above equation could hold values of which are not nonnegative integers. For example, if the equation held true for , we would obtain or .  Notice that since is not an integer the power series no longer terminates. Although Newton did not prove that this power series was correct (nor did we), he tested it by multiplying the power series by itself. When he saw that by squaring the power series he started to obtain , he was convinced that the power series was exactly equal to .   Binomial Series, the squaring the   Consider the power series representation .

This convinced him even further that he had the correct power series.   second series expansion      Show that and use this to show that .    We now have two power series for calculating : the one from part (a) and the one derived earlier, namely . We will explore which one converges to faster. First define and . Use a computer algebra system to compute and for . Which one appears to converge to faster?       In general the power series representation is called the binomial series (or Newton s binomial series). This power series is correct when is a non-negative integer (after all, that is how we got the series in the first place). We can also see that it is correct when as we obtain which can be obtained from the geometric series .  In fact, the binomial series is the correct power series representation for all values of the exponent (though we haven t proved this yet).     Assuming that the binomial series works for , show that       Integrate the above to obtain the following power series for .

  "body": " Taylor s Formula  As we saw in , representing functions as power series was a fruitful strategy for mathematicans in the eighteenth century (as it still is). Differentiating and integrating power series term by term was relatively easy, seemed to work, and led to many applications. Furthermore, power series representations for all of the elementary functions could be obtained if one was clever enough. However, cleverness is an unreliable tool. It would be better to have some systematic way to find a power series for a given function that doesn t rely on being sufficiently cleve.  To be sure, there were nagging questions. For example. even if we can find a power series representation of some function, how do we know that the series we ve created represents the function we started with? Even worse, is it possible for a function to have more than one power series representation centered at a given value This uniqueness issue is addressed by the following theorem.   Taylor s Formula  Taylor s Formula   If , then , where represents the th derivative of evaluated at .    A few comments about are in order. Notice that we did not start with a function and derive its series representation. Instead we defined  to be the series we wrote down. This assumes that the expression actually has meaning (that it converges). At this point we have every reason to expect that it does, however expectation is not proof so we note that this is an assumption, not an established truth. We ve also assumed that we can differentiate an infinite polynomial term-by-term as we would a finite polynomial. As before, we follow in the footsteps of our 18th century forebears in making these assumptions. For now.   Taylor s Formula   Prove .    The zeroth derivative (the function itself) at is given by . Differentiate to obtain the other terms.    From we see that if we do start with the function then no matter how we obtain its power series, the result will always be the same. The series   is called the Taylor series for expanded about (or centered at) . Although this systematic machine for obtaining power series for a function seems to have been known to a number of mathematicians in the early 1700s, Brook Taylor (1685 1731) was the first to publish this result in his Methodus Incrementorum (1715). The special case when was included by Colin Maclaurin (1698 1746) in his Treatise of Fluxions (1742). Thus when , the series is often called the Maclaurin Series for .

Taylor s Formula drill problems   Use Taylor s formula to find the Taylor series of the given function expanded about the given point .      ,        ,        ,        ,        ,      The prime notation for the derivative was not used by Taylor, Maclaurin or their contemporaries. It was introduced by Joseph Louis Lagrange in his 1779 work Thèorie des Fonctions Analytiques . In that work, Lagrange sought to get rid of Leibniz infinitesimals and base Calculus on the power series idea. His idea was that by representing every function as a power series, Calculus could be done algebraically by manipulating power series and examining various aspects of the series representation instead of appealing to the controversial notion of infinitesimals. He implicitly assumed that every continuous function could be replaced with its power series representation.   Joseph-Louis Lagrange  Lagrange, Joseph-Louis portrait of  Portraits Lagrange      That is, he wanted to think of the Taylor series as a great big polynomial, because polynomials are easy to work with. It was a very simple, yet exceedingly clever and far-reaching idea. Since , for example, why not just define the exponential to be the series and work with the series. After all, the series is just a very long polynomial.  This idea did not come out of nowhere. Particular infinite series, such as the Geometric Series had been known and studied for many years. Later, in the 18th century Leonhard Euler used infinite series to solve many problems, and some of his solutions are still quite breath taking when you first see them .  Taking his cue from the Taylor series Lagrange observed that the coefficient of provides the th derivative of at (divided by ). Modifying formula to suit his purpose, Lagrange supposed that every differentiable function could be represented as .  In that case is the derivative of at , and generally .  Lagrange dubbed his function the fonction dérivée from which we get the modern name derivative .    Let be a fixed number. We saw in that the power series of expanded about is given by                   Apply Lagrange's idea to show that .      Now compute by directly by differentiating. Do you get the same result?

Compare with the results you get from differentiating directly.                In you determined the power series expansion of about . Apply Lagrange's idea to show that every derivative of is given by .      In part (b) of you determined the power series expansion of about . Apply Lagrange's idea to show that the derivative of is .     As we observed in Leibniz and his peers would have regarded the expression as a fraction (of differentials) so they would have derived the formula by simply canceling the that appears in the numerator and denominator, just as we did in (or sometimes by uncancelling them to get the left side of equation from the right side). Mathematicians of that era would have regarded this operation as basic algebra.  Eighteenth and nineteenth century arithmetic primers used the phrase chain rule to describe the daisy chain of symbolic cancellations that occurs when we convert units. For example, to convert yards to inches we compute .  Since the cancellations in equation appeared to be just another example of the older chain rule the name was adopted by 20th century Calculus textbooks even though in modern times it is better understood as a mnemonic for the deeper and more abstract operation of computing the derivative of composed functions like .  Letting and and using Lagrange s prime notation we see that in modern form the chain rule for Calculus is: . Which obviously looks nothing like the older chain rule seen as in equation   In his Théorie des fonctions analytiques (1797) Lagrange provided a derivation of the Chain Rule in these more modern terms. The following problem captures his idea.         Expand as a power series expanded about .      Expand as a power series expanded about and substitute your answer from part (a) for .      Show that the coefficient of the linear term in part (b) is given by      All in all, Lagrange s idea was very clever and insightful. It s only real flaw is that the fundamental, underlying assumption is not true. It turns out that not every differentiable function can be represented as a Taylor series. This was demonstrated very dramatically by Augustin Cauchy s famous counter-example .  This function is actually infinitely differentiable everywhere but its Maclaurin series (that is, its Taylor series with ) does not converge to (except, trivially, at the origin) because all of its derivatives at the origin are equal to zero. That is .  To begin with, let s compute a few derivatives when . .  As you can see the calculations are already getting a little complicated and we ve only taken the second derivative.  Conceptually, it is not difficult to compute these derivatives using the tools you learned in Calculus but the formulas involved do become complicated rather quickly. Some care must be taken to avoid error. To streamline things a bit we take , and define so that .  Cauchy s Counterexample, Part 1  Cauchy, Augustin Cauchy s counterexample part 1   In this problem and in  is the function defined in equation .  To simplify the notation we make the following definitions: and .     Find in terms of .    You are differentiating with respect to , not .      Use induction on to show that is a polynomial for all .     Unfortunately everything we ve done so far only gives us the derivatives we need when is not zero, and we need the derivatives when  is zero. To find these we need to get back to very basic ideas.  Let s assume for the moment that we know that and recall that .  We can close the deal with the following problem.  Cauchy s Counterexample, Part 2  Cauchy, Augustin Cauchy s counterexample part 2    Let be a nonnegative integer. Show that .    Induction and a dash of L Hôpital's rule should do the trick.      Prove that for any polynomial .      Let be as in equation and show that for every nonnegative integer , .     This example showed that while it was fruitful to exploit Taylor series representations of various functions, basing the foundations of Calculus on power series was not a sound idea.  While Lagrange s approach wasn't totally successful, it was a major step away from infinitesimals and toward the modern approach. We still use aspects of it today. For instance we still use his prime notation to denote the derivative.  Turning Lagrange s idea on its head it is clear that if we know how to compute derivatives, we can use this machine to obtain a power series when we are not clever enough to obtain the series by other (typically shorter) means. For example, consider Newton s binomial series when . Originally, we obtained this series by extending the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents. Taylor s formula provides a more systematic procedure. First we compute the derivatives of at zero: and in general since .  Next we substitute into Taylor s formula to obtain the series which agrees with equation in the previous chapter.   Taylor s Formula use to obtain the general binomial series   Use Taylor s formula to obtain the general binomial series     As you can see, Taylor s machine will produce the power series for a function (if it has one), but is tedious to perform. We will find, generally, that this tediousness can be an obstacle to understanding. In many cases it will be better, or at least quicker, to be clever if we can. However, it is comforting to have Taylor s formula available as a last resort.  The existence of a Taylor series is addressed (to some degree) by the following.   Taylor s Theorem  Taylor s Theorem   If are all continuous on an interval containing and , then . The last term in this expression, , is called the Integral Form of the Remainder of the Taylor series.    The proof of will be by Mathematical Induction but before we address the proof, notice that the th degree polynomial resembles the Taylor series and, in fact, is called the  th degree Taylor polynomial of about . says that a function can be written as the sum of this polynomial and a specific integral which we will analyze in .  We will get the proof started and leave the formal induction proof as an exercise. To begin the induction notice that when  equation is a restatement of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus : . which we rewrite as in order to provide the anchor step (when ) for our induction.   The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus  Strictly speaking, this proof will not be complete until we prove the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in , but you should be familiar with it from your Calculus course.   To derive the case where , we use integration by parts. If we let we obtain .   Taylor s Theorem   Provide a formal induction proof for .    "

  "title": "Series Anomalies",
  "body": " Series Anomalies  Until we began this chapter our approach to series mirrored that of the eighteenth century mathematicians. By exploiting the ideas of Calculus and power series they ingeniously derived mathematical results which were virtually unobtainable before. Mathematicans were eager to push these techniques as far as they could to obtain their results and they often showed good intuition regarding what was mathematically acceptable and what was not. However, as the envelope was pushed further and further, substantial questions about the validity of their methods surfaced.  As an illustration consider the series expansion .  If we substitute into this equation, we obtain .  If we group the terms as follows , the series would equal . A regrouping of provides an answer of . This violation of the associative law of addition did not escape the mathematicians of the 1700s. In his 1760 paper On Divergent Series Euler said:    Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm Notable enough, however are the controversies over the series , whose sum was given by Leibniz as , although others disagree . . . Understanding of this question is to be sought in the word sum; this idea, if thus conceived namely, the sum of a series is said to be that quantity to which it is brought closer as more terms of a series are taken has relevance only for the convergent series, and we should in general give up this idea of sum for divergent series. On the other hand, as series in analysis arise from the expansion of fractions or irrational quantities or even of transcendentals, it will, in turn, be permissible in calculation to substitute in place of such series that quantity out of whose development it is produced.   Even with this formal approach to series, an interesting question arises. The series for the antiderivative of does converge for while this one does not. Specifically, one antiderivative of the above series is .  If we substitute into this series, we obtain . It is not hard to see that such an alternating series converges. The following picture shows why. In this diagram, denotes the partial sum .           From the diagram we can see and . It seems that the sequence of partial sums will converge to whatever is in the middle. Our diagram indicates that it is ln in the middle but actually this is not obvious. Nonetheless it is interesting that one series converges for but the other does not.     series Taylor s series used to approximate Use the fact that to determine how many terms of the series should be added together to approximate to within without actually computing what is.    These examples illustrate something even more perplexing. As we ve observed the divergent infinite sum does not appear satisfy the associative law for addition. Since the sum diverges (is meaningless) this is not too surprising. On the other hand while the convergent series does satisfy the associative law as expected, it does not satisfy the commutative law. In fact, shows that it fails to be commutative rather spectacularly.   Riemann, Bernhard  Bernhard Riemann (1826 1866) stated and proved a generalization of the following theorem in 1854.   Bernhard Riemann  Portraits Riemann  Riemann, Bernhard portrait of   Portrait of Bernhard Riemann     series Alternating Harmonic Series rearrangements of   Let be any real number. There exists a rearrangement of the Alternating Harmonic Series  which converges to .    This theorem shows that a series is most decidedly not a great big sum. It follows that power series are not just great big polynomials.   series Harmonic Series To set the stage, consider the Harmonic Series  .  Even though the individual terms in this series converge to , the series still diverges (to infinity) as evidenced by the inequality .  Armed with this fact, we can see why is true. First note that and .  This says that if we add enough terms of we can make such a sum as large as we wish (and negative) and if we add enough terms of we can make such a sum as large as we wish (and positive). Those facts provide us with the general outline of the proof. The trick is to add just enough positive terms until the sum is just greater than . Then we start to add on negative terms until the sum is just less than . Picking up where we left off with the positive terms, we add on just enough positive terms until we are just above again. We then add on negative terms until we are below . In essence, we are bouncing back and forth around . If we do this carefully, then we can get this rearrangement to converge to . The notation in the proof below gets a bit hairy, but keep this general idea in mind as you read through it.  Let be the first odd integer such that . Now choose to be the first even integer such that .  Thus .  Notice that we still have . With this in mind, choose to be the first odd integer with   Thus we have   Furthermore, since we have   In a similar fashion choose to be the first even integer such that .  Since we see that   Again choose to be the first odd integer such that and notice that .  Continue defining and in this fashion for . Since , it is evident that the partial sums and must converge to . Furthermore, it is evident that every partial sum of the rearrangement is trapped between two such extreme partial sums. This forces the entire rearranged series to converge to .  The two parts of the next problem are extentions of but they are a bit simpler notationally since we don t need to worry about converging to an actual number. We only need to make the rearrangement increase or decrease without bound.   series Alternating Harmonic Series rearrangements of   Show that there is a rearrangement of the Alternating Harmonic Series , which:     Diverges to .      Diverges to .                It is fun to know that we can rearrange some series to make them add up to anything we like but there is a more fundamental idea at play here. That the negative terms of the Alternating Harmonic Series diverge to negative infinity and the positive terms diverge to positive infinity make the convergence of the alternating series very special.  Consider what happens when we sum the series. We start with . This is a positive term so our sum is starting to increase without bound. Next we add which is a negative terms so our sum has turned around and is now starting to decrease without bound. Then another positive term is added: increasing without bound. Then another negative term: decreasing. And so on. The convergence of the alternating Harmonic Series is the result of a delicate balance between a tendency to run off to positive infinity and back to negative infinity. When viewed in this light it is not really too surprising that rearranging the terms can destroy this delicate balance.  Naturally, the alternating Harmonic Series is not the only such series. Any such series is said to converge conditionally  the condition being the specific arrangement of the terms.  To stir the pot a bit more, some series do satisfy the commutative property. More specifically, one can show that any rearrangement of the series must converge to the same value as the original series (which happens to be ). Why does one series behave so nicely whereas the other does not?  Issues such as these and, more generally, the validity of using the infinitely small and infinitely large certainly existed in the 1700s, but they were overshadowed by the utility of the Calculus. Indeed, foundational questions raised by the above examples, while certainly interesting and of importance, did not significantly deter the exploitation of Calculus in studying physical phenomena. However, the envelope eventually was pushed to the point that not even the most practically oriented mathematician could avoid the foundational issues.  "

  "body": "Joseph Fourier and His Series  Applying mathematics to physical problems such as heat flow in a solid body drew much attention in the latter part of the 1700's and the early part of the 1800's. One of the people to attack the heat flow problem was Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768 1839).   Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier  Fourier, Jean Baptiste Joseph portrait of  Portraits Fourier       Fourier, Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier submitted a manuscript on the subject, Sur la propagation de la chaleur ( On the Propagation of Heat ), to the Institut National des Sciences et des Arts in 1807. These ideas were subsequently published in La theorie analytique de la chaleur ( The Analytic Theory of Heat (1822) ).  To examine Fourier s ideas, consider the example of a thin wire of length one, which is perfectly insulated and whose endpoints are held at a fixed temperature of zero. Given an initial temperature distribution in the wire, the problem is to monitor the temperature of the wire at any point and at any time . Specifically, if we let denote the temperature of the wire at point at time , then it can be shown that must satisfy the one-dimensional heat equation , where is a positive constant known as the thermal diffusivity . If the initial temperature distribution is given by the function , then the we are seeking must satisfy all of the following   To do this, Fourier employed what is now referred to as the method of separation of variables. Specifically, Fourier looked for solutions of the form ; that is, solutions where the -part can be separated from the -part. Assuming that has this form, we get and . Substituting these into equation  , we obtain .  Since the left-hand side involves no 's and the right-hand side involves no 's, both sides must equal a constant . Thus we have    Heat Equation, the  Heat Equation, the parameter must be less than zero   Show that satisfies the equation , where is an arbitrary constant, , and is a physical constant called the thermal diffusivity . Use the physics of the problem to show that if is not constantly zero, then .    Consider .    Using the result from that , we will let .

Conclude that if is not constantly zero, then , where is any integer.     Heat Equation, the fundamental solutions of   Show that if and satisfy the equations and then satisfy them as well, where and are arbitrary constants.     Fourier, Jean Baptiste Joseph Putting all of these results together, Fourier surmised that the general solution to could be expressed as the series .  All that is left is to have satisfy the initial condition , . That is, we need to find coefficients , such that .  The idea of representing a function as a series of sine waves was proposed by Daniel Bernoulli in 1753 while examining the problem of modeling a vibrating string. Unfortunately for Bernoulli, he didn't know how to compute the coefficients in such a series representation. What distinguished Fourier was that he developed a technique to compute these coefficients. The key is the result of the following problem.   orthogonality of  orthogonality of   Let and be positive integers. Show      Fourier, Jean Baptiste Joseph Armed with the result from , Fourier could compute the coefficients in the series representation in the following manner. Since we are trying to find for a particular (albeit general) , we will temporarily change the index in the summation from to . With this in mind, consider which leads to the formula .  The series with is called the Fourier (sine) series of .    Let's apply this to the function, , whose graph of this function is seen below.        Fourier Series sine series of an odd function   Let be a positive integer. Show that if then and show that the Fourier sine series of is given by     To see evidence that this series really does, in fact, represent on , let be the partial sum of the series.

This would seem to be strong evidence that series converges to the function and therefore . is a valid representation of as a Fourier series.  But is it?  Recall, that when we represented a function as a power series, we freely differentiated and integrated the series term by term as though it was a polynomial. Let's do the same with this Fourier series.  To start, notice that the derivative of is given by .  This derivative does not exist at and its graph is given by   Graph of       If we differentiate the Fourier series in equation term by term, we obtain . Let be the partial sum of this Fourier cosine series. The sketches below display the graphs of when , , , and .     Graph of     Graph of       Graph of     Graph of                   In fact, if we were to graph the series cos , we would obtain the following graph:           Notice that this agrees with the graph of , except that didn t exist at , and this series takes on the value at . Notice also, that every partial sum of this series is continuous, since it is a finite combination of continuous cosine functions. This agrees with what you learned in Calculus, the (finite) sum of continuous functions is always continuous. In the 1700s it was assumed (falsely) that this could be extended to infinite series, because every time a power series converged to a function, that function happened to be continuous. This never failed for power series, so this example was a bit disconcerting as it is an example of the sum of infinitely many continuous functions which is, in this case, discontinuous. Was it possible that there was some power series which converged to a function which was not continuous? Even if there isn t, what is the difference between power series and this Fourier series?  Even more disconcerting is what happens if we differentiate the series term by term as before. Given the above graph of this series, it appears that the derivative of it should be constantly 0, except at , where the derivative doesn t exist. But when we perform the differentiation term by term we obtain the series . and if we graph the sum of the first forty terms of this series, we get:              We knew that there might be a problem at but this is crazy! The series doesn t seem to be converging to zero at all!   Fourier Series  Fourier Series divergent Fourier series example   Show that when       shows that when we differentiate the series term by term, this differentiated series doesn't converge to anything at , let alone converge to zero. In this case, the old Calculus rule that the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives does not apply for this infinite sum, though it did apply before. As if the continuity issue wasn't bad enough before, this was even worse. Power series were routinely differentiated and integrated term-by-term. This was part of their appeal. They were treated like infinite polynomials. Either there is some power series lurking that refuses to behave nicely, or there is some property that power series have that not all Fourier series have.  Could it be that everything we did in was bogus?   We will prove all of these assertions in .   Fortunately, the answer to that question is, No. Power series are generally much more well behaved than Fourier series. Whenever a power series converges, the function it converges to will be continuous. And, as long as one stays inside the interval of convergence, power series can be differentiated and integrated term by term. Power series have something going for them that your average Fourier series does not, but none of this is any more obvious to us than it was to mathematicians at the beginning of the nineteenth century. What they did (and we do) know was that relying on intuition was perilous and that rigorous formulations were needed to either justify or dismiss these intuitions. In some sense, the nineteenth century was the morning after the mathematical party that went on throughout the eighteenth century.   orthogonality of  orthogonality of   Let and be positive integers.

  "body": " Sequences of Real Numbers  In , we developed the equation , and we mentioned that there are limitations to this power series representation. For example, substituting and into this expression leads to which are rather hard to accept. On the other hand, if we substitute into the expression we get which seems more palatable. Until we think about it.  We can add two numbers together by the method we all learned in elementary school. Or three numbers. Or any finite set of numbers. At least in principle. But infinitely many? What does that even mean?  Before we can add infinitely many numbers together we must find a way to give meaning to the idea of adding infinitely many numbers. To do this, we examine an infinite sum by thinking of it as a sequence of finite partial sums .   Sequence vs. Series  Sequence vs. Series  We assume that you are familiar with the distinction between a sequence and a series from your Calculus course. However, for the sake of clarity we ll make this explicit here. A sequence numbers is simply a comma separated list of numbers. A single number from a sequence is an element of the sequence. A series is the sum of the elements of a sequence .  For example, is a Geometric Sequence , whereas is a Geometric Series .   From equation we would have the following sequence of partial sums . .  We can plot these sums on a number line to see what they tend toward as gets large.       Since each partial sum is located at the midpoint between the previous partial sum and , it is reasonable to suppose that these sums tend to the number 2. Indeed, you have probably seen an expression such as justified by a similar argument. Of course, relying on pictures is fine if we are satisfied with intuition. However, to establish rigor we cannot rely on pictures or such nebulous words as approaches.   No doubt you are wondering What s wrong with the word approaches ? It seems clear enough to me. This is often a sticking point. But if we think carefully about what we mean by the word approach we see that there is an implicit assumption that will cause us some difficulties later if we don t expose it.  To see this consider the sequence . Clearly it approaches zero, right? But, doesn t it also approach  It does, in the sense that each term gets closer to than the one previous. But it also approaches  , , or even in the same sense. That s the problem with the word approaches. It just says that at each step we re closer to something than we were in the previous step. It does not tell us that we are actually getting close. Since the moon moves in an elliptical orbit about the earth for part of each month it is approaching the earth. The moon gets clos er to the earth but, thankfully, it does not get close to the earth.  The implicit assumption we alluded to earlier is this: When we say that the sequence  approaches zero we mean that it is getting close not clos er . Ordinarily this kind of vagueness in our language is pretty innocuous. When we say approaches in casual conversation we can usually tell from the context of the conversation whether we mean getting close to or getting closer to. But when speaking mathematically we need to be more careful, more explicit, in the language we use.  So how can we change the language we use so that this ambiguity is eliminated? We start by recognizing, rigorously, what we mean when we say that a sequence converges to zero. For example, you would probably want to say that the sequence converges to zero. Is there a way to give this meaning without relying on pictures or intuition?  One way would be to say that we can make as close to zero as we wish, provided we make large enough. But even this needs to be made more specific. For example, we can get to within a distance of of provided we make , we can get to within a distance of of provided we make , etc. After a few such examples it is apparent that given any arbitrary distance , we can get to within of provided we make . This leads to the following definition.   Convergence to Zero of a Sequence    sequences convergence to zero  Definition convergence of a sequence to zero Let be a sequence of real numbers. We say that  converges to 0 and write provided for any , there is a real number such that if , then .     Notes on :   This definition is the formal version of the idea we just talked about. Given an arbitrary distance , we must be able to find a specific number such that is within of , whenever . The is the answer to the question, how large is large enough to put this close to .    Even though we didn t need it in the example , the absolute value appears in the definition because we need to make the distance from to 0 smaller than . Without the absolute value in the definition, we would be able to prove such outrageous statements as , which we obviously don t want.    The statement can also be written as or . (See the below.) Any one of these equivalent formulations can be used to prove convergence. Depending on the application, one of these may be more advantageous to use than the others.    Any time an can be found that works for a particular , any number will work for that as well, since if then .      absolute value   Let and be real numbers with . Prove if and only if .  Notice that this can be extended to if and only if .    To illustrate how makes the above ideas rigorous, let s use it to prove that .   Let be given. Let . If , then and so . Hence by definition, .   Notice that this proof is rigorous and makes no reference to vague notions such as getting smaller or approaching infinity. It has three components:  provide the challenge of a distance ,  identify a real number , and  show that this works for this given .  There is also no explanation about where came from. While it is true that this choice of is not surprising in light of the scrapwork we did before the definition, the motivation for how we got it is not in the formal proof nor is it required. In fact, such scrapwork is typically not included in a formal proof. For example, consider the following.    Use to prove that .     Let . Let . If , then and . Thus . Hence by definition, .   Notice that the came out of nowhere, but you can probably see the thought process that went into this choice: We needed to use the inequality . Again this scrapwork is not part of the formal proof, but it is typically necessary for finding what should be. You might be able to do the next problem without doing any scrapwork first, but don t hesitate to do scrapwork if you need it.   convergence of a sequence convergence to zero drill   Use to prove the following.                    In this example we ll use to prove .  As the sequences get more complicated, doing scrapwork ahead of time becomes more necessary.   SCRAPWORK   Given an , we need to see how large to make in order to guarantee that . First notice that . Also, notice that if , then . So as long as , we have . We can make this less than if we make . This means we need to make and , simultaneously. These can be done if we let be the maximum of these two numbers. This sort of thing comes up regularly, so the notation was developed to mean the maximum of these two numbers. Notice that if then and . We re now ready for the formal proof.     Let . Let . If , then and . Thus we have and . Therefore .  Hence by definition, .   Again we emphasize that the scrapwork is not explicitly a part of the formal proof. However, if you look carefully, you can always find the scrapwork in the formal proof.   convergence of a sequence convergence to zero drill   Use to prove that      limit if   Let be a nonzero real number with and let .     Solve the inequality for       Use part (a) to prove .      Where does your proof in part (c) break down if ?     We can negate to prove that a particular sequence does not converge to zero. Before we look at an example, let s analyze what it means for a sequence to not converge to zero.  Converging to zero means that any time a distance is given, we must be able to respond with a number such that for every . To have this not happen, we must be able to find some such that no choice of will work. Of course, if we find such an , then any smaller value will also fail to have such an , but we only need one.    Use the definition to prove that the sequence does not converge to zero.     If you stare at the example long enough, you see that any with will cause problems. For the sake of specificity (rigor) we will let .  Also let be any integer. If we let be any non negative integer with , then , but . Thus no choice of will satisfy the conditions of the definition for this , (namely that for all ) and so .    limit definition of non-existence    Negate to provide a formal definition for .         Use your definition from part (a) to prove .     Now that we have a handle on how to rigorously prove that a sequence converges to zero, let s generalize this to a formal definition for a sequence converging to something else. Basically, we want to say that a sequence converges to a real number , provided the difference converges to zero. This leads to the following definition:   Convergence of a Sequence    sequences convergence  Definition convergence of a sequence Let be a sequence of real numbers and let be a real number. We say that converges to and write provided for any , there is a real number such that if , then .    Notes on    Clearly if and only if .           Again notice that this says that we can make as close to as we wish (within ) by making large enough ( . As before, this definition makes these notions very specific.    Notice that can be written in the following equivalent forms                          and we are free to use any one of these which is convenient at the time.      Double Implication  The phrase if and only if (seen in item 1 above) is a term of art in mathematics. The symbol is equivalent.  Formally it means that each statement follows logically from the other. If you are asked to prove the statement you need to first assume that is true to prove . Then you assume that is true to prove .  In a classroom setting it is often abbreviated as iff.    As an example, let s use this definition to prove that the sequence in part (b) of converges to .    Prove .   SCRAPWORK   Given an , we need to get . This prompts us to do some algebra. .  This in turn, seems to suggest that should work.     Let . Let . If , then and so . Hence .  Thus by definition .   Notice again that the scrapwork is not part of the formal proof and the author of a proof is not obligated to explain where the choice of came from (although the thought process can usually be seen in the formal proof). The formal proof contains only these requisite three parts:  provide the challenge of an arbitrary ,  provide a specific , and  show that this works for the given .    Also notice that given a specific sequence such as , the definition does not indicate what the limit would be if in fact, it exists. Once an educated guess is made the definition only verifies that this intuition is correct.  This leads to the following question: If intuition is needed to determine what a limit of a sequence should be, then what is the purpose of this relatively non intuitive, complicated definition?  Remember that when these rigorous formulations were developed, intuitive notions of convergence were already in place and had been used with great success. But the arguments based on them could not be fully justified. This definition was developed to address the foundational issues, not to help us compute limits.  Could our intuitions be verified in a concrete fashion that was above reproach? This was the purpose of this non-intuitive definition. It was to be used to verify that our intuition was, in fact, correct and do so in a very prescribed manner. For example, if is a fixed number, then you would probably say as approaches infinity, approaches . After all, we did already prove that . We should be able to back up this intuition with our rigorous definition.     limit if Let . Use to prove .    You will probably need to separate this into two cases: and .     series Geometric series convergence\/divergence conditions for    Prove that if , then .

  "title": "The Limit as a Primary Tool",
  "body": " The Limit as a Primary Tool  As you saw in the previous section the formal definition of the convergence of a sequence is meant to capture rigorously our intuitive understanding of convergence. However, the definition itself is an unwieldy tool. If only there were some way to be rigorous without having to run back to the definition each time. Fortunately, there is a way. If we can use the definition to prove some general rules about limits then we could use these rules whenever they apply and be assured that everything was still rigorous. A number of these should look familiar from Calculus.   Limit of a Constant Sequence is the Constant  limit of a constant sequence  sequences constant sequences   Let be a constant sequence. Show that .    In proving the familiar limit theorems, the following will be a very useful tool.   Triangle Inequalities  Triangle Inequalities Triangle Inequality  Triangle Inequalities Reverse Triangle Inequalitiy      Triangle Inequality:  Let and be real numbers. Then .    Reverse Triangle Inequality:  Let and be real numbers. Then         Triangle Inequalities Triangle Inequality    Prove .    For the Reverse Triangle Inequality, consider .      Show .    You want to show that and that .      Limit of a Sum of Sequences is the Sum of the Limits  limit of a sum of sequences   If and , then .    We will often state this theorem informally as the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits. However, to be absolutely precise, what it says is that if we already know that two sequences converge, then the sequence formed by summing their corresponding terms will also converge and in fact, it will converge to the sum of those individual limits.     sequences termwise sums of   Prove .  We ll provide the scrapwork and leave the formal write up to you. Be sure you justify every step. Also, note the role of the triangle inequality in the proof.   SCRAPWORK:   If we let , then we want to find such that if , then . Since we know that and , we can make and as small as we wish, provided we make large enough. Let s go back to what we want, to see if we can close the gap between what we know and what we want. We know, by the triangle inequality, that . To make this whole thing less than , it makes sense to make each part less than .  Fortunately, we can do that as the definitions of and allow us to make and arbitrarily small.  Specifically, since , there exists an such that if then . Also since , there exists an such that if then . Since we want both of these to occur, it makes sense to let max . This should be the that we seek.                                             Limit of the Product of Sequences is the Product of the Limits  limit of a product of sequences  limit products of   If and , then .     SCRAPWORK: Given , we want so that if , then . One of the standard tricks in analysis is to uncancel. In this case we will subtract and add a convenient term. Normally these would cancel out, which is why we say that we will uncancel to put them back in. You already saw an example of this in proving the Reverse Triangle Inequality ( ). In the present case, consider .  We can make this whole thing less than , provided we make each term in the sum less than . We can make if we make .  But wait! What if ?  We could handle this as a separate case or we can do the following slick trick. Notice that we can add one more line to the above string of inequalities: . Now we can make and not worry about dividing by zero.  Making requires a bit more finesse. At first glance, one would be tempted to try and make . Even if we ignore the fact that we could be dividing by zero (which we could handle), we have a bigger problem. According to the definition of , we can make smaller than any given fixed positive number, as long as we make large enough (larger than some which goes with a given epsilon). Unfortunately, is not fixed as it has the variable in it; there is no reason to believe that a single will work with all possible values of simultaneously. To handle this impasse, we need the following:   sequences convergence convergent sequences are bounded    A Convergent Sequence Is Bounded.   If , then there exists such that for all .     sequences convergence convergent sequences are bounded   Prove .    We know that there exists such that if , then . Let max , where represents the smallest integer greater than or equal to .            sequences if the sequence is bounded then   Prove that if the sequence is bounded then .    Armed with we can add the following inequality to the scrapwork above.   At this point, we should be able to make the last line of this less than .

The following theorem is the analog of for quotients.   Limit of the Quotient of Sequences is the Quotient of the Limits  limit of a quotient of sequences   Suppose and . Also suppose and .  Then .     sequences termwise quotient of   Prove .   SCRAPWORK   It is helpful to look first at the special case . The general case will follow from this and from .  Consider . We are faced with the same dilemma we had when we were proving ; we need to get bounded above. This means we need to get bounded away from zero (at least for large enough ).  This can be done as follows. Since , then . Thus, by the definition of there exists such that if , then . Thus when , and so . This says that for , . We should be able to make this smaller than a given , provided we make large enough.    The results of , , , and allow us to find the limits of complicated sequences and then rigorously verify that these are in fact, the correct limits without resorting to the definition of a limit.   limit identifing the theorems used in a limit  limit of ratios of polynomials    Use the theorems from this section to prove that .          Prove that , provided .  Be sure to explain why division by zero is not an issue. (See the hint.)    A polynomial only has finitely many roots.     There is one more theorem which will prove to be a valuable tool.

The Squeeze Theorem is true even if only holds for sufficiently large ; i.e., for larger than some fixed . This is true because when you find an that works in the original proof, this can be modified by choosing max . Also note that this theorem really says two things:   converges, and  it converges to .  This subtle point affects how one should properly use the Squeeze Theorem.    Prove .     Notice that . Since , then by the Squeeze Theorem, .   Notice that this proof is completely rigorous. This is the proper way to use the Squeeze Theorem. Here is an example of an improper use of the Squeeze Theorem.   How Not to Use the Squeeze Theorem  Look again at . Notice that , so and .  This is incorrect in form because it presumes that exists, which we don t yet know. If we knew that the limit existed to begin with, then this would be fine. The Squeeze Theorem proves that the limit does in fact exist, but it must be so stated.   The general theorems we have seen in this section will allow us to rigorously explore convergence of power series in the next chapter without appealing directly to the definitions. However there will still be times when we will need to apply the definition directly.  But before we go into that let s examine divergence a bit more closely.  "

  "title": "Divergence",
  "body": " Divergence  In we saw that there is a rearrangment of the alternating Harmonic series which diverges to or . In that section we did not fuss over any formal notions of divergence. We assumed instead that you are already familiar with the concept of divergence, probably from taking Calculus in the past.  However we are now in the process of building precise, formal definitions for the concepts we will be using so we define the divergence of a sequence as follows.   sequences divergence of  divergence of a sequence   A sequence of real numbers diverges if it does not converge to any .    It may seem unnecessarily pedantic of us to insist on formally stating such an obvious definition. After all converge and diverge are opposites in ordinary English. Why wouldn t they be mathematically opposite too? Why do we have to go to the trouble of formally defining both of them? Since they are opposites defining one implicitly defines the other doesn t it?  One way to answer that criticism is to state that in mathematics we always work from precisely stated definitions and tightly reasoned logical arguments.  But this is just more pedantry. It is a way of saying, Because we said so all dressed up in imposing language. We need to do better than that.  One reason for providing formal definitions of both convergence and divergence is that in mathematics we frequently co-opt words from natural languages like English and imbue them with mathematical meaning that is only tangentially related to the original English definition. When we take two such words which happen to be opposites in English and give them mathematical meanings which are not opposites it can be very confusing, especially at first.  This is what happened with the words open and closed. These are opposites in English: not open is closed,  not closed is open, and there is nothing which is both open and closed. But recall that an open interval on the real line, , is one that does not include either of its endpoints while a closed interval, , is one that includes both of them.  These may seem like opposites at first but they are not. To see this observe that the interval is neither open nor closed since it only contains one of its endpoints. If open and closed were mathematically opposite then every interval would be either open or closed.   Open Sets vs. Closed Sets  It is also true that is both open and closed. We will discuss this a bit further in .   Mathematicians have learned to be extremely careful about this sort of thing. In the case of convergence and divergence of a series, even though these words are actually opposites mathematically (every sequence either converges or diverges and no sequence converges and diverges) it is better to say this explicitly so there can be no confusion.  A sequence can only converge to a real number, , in one way: by getting arbitrarily close to . However there are several ways a sequence might diverge.    Consider the sequence, . This clearly diverges by getting larger and larger Ooops! Let s be careful. The sequence gets larger and larger too, but it converges. What we meant to say was that the terms of the sequence become arbitrarily large as increases.  This is clearly a divergent sequence but it may not be clear how to prove it formally. Here s one way.  To show divergence we must show that the sequence satisfies the negation of the definition of convergence. That is, we must show that for every there is an such that for every , there is an with .  To prove that the sequence diverges let and be given. Take . Let be the smallest positive integer which is greater than . Finally take to be greater than , and .  Since we see that . Thus . Therefore the sequence diverges.            The fact that diverges can be proved by simpler means than we used in . For example, we could use .   Prove that diverges using .   We could also make (below), and then use which follows it. After proving the lemma of course.  Since these (much) simpler methods were available to us why do you suppose we chose to present a tedious and difficult proof based on the negation of ?  The fact is that mathematical definitions are not primarily intended to serve as tools for problem solving (theorem proving). The chief purpose of a definition is to clarify our ideas and make them precise. Lemmas and theorems (the solutions of problems) are then built up logically from definitions. And they provide the tools we need to solve more difficult, or abstract problems (prove lemmas and theorems). Recall that in we empasized that A problem, once solved, becomes a tool for solving subsequent problems! Taken together , , , and are intended to illustrate the robustness of this approach to mathematics.

Recall that the Taylor series of a function expanded about the point is given by   When we say that for a particular value of , what we mean is that the sequence of partial sums converges to the number . Note that the index in the summation was changed to to allow to represent the index of the sequence of partial sums. As intimidating as this may look, bear in mind that for a fixed real number , this is still a sequence of real numbers so, that saying means that and in the previous chapter we developed some tools to examine this phenomenon. In particular, we know that is equivalent to .  We have seen an example of this already. In you had to show that the geometric series, converges to ,for by showing that .  For the issue at hand (convergence of a Taylor series), we don t need to analyze the series itself. What we need to show is that the difference between the function and the th partial sum converges to zero. This difference is called the remainder (of the Taylor series) . (Why?)  While it is true that the remainder is simply , it is not easy to work with it in this form. Fortunately, a number of alternate forms of this remainder are available. We will explore some of those in this chapter.   Remainder of the Taylor Series Integral Form of Recall from from that, or . which we can rewrite as . The expression is called the Integral Form of the remainder of the Taylor series of .  Clearly, the Taylor series will converge to exactly when . The Integral Form of the remainder is usually easier to work with than the original form: and we can use the Integral Form to obtain some conditions which guarantee the convergence of particular Taylor series such as the following.   series Taylor s series   If there exists a real number such that for all nonnegative integers and for all on an interval containing and , then and so     In order to prove this, it might help to first prove the following.

Recall that in we showed that if we define the function by the power series then . This, of course, is just the familiar addition property of integer exponents extended to any real number. In we had to assume that defining as a series was meaningful because we did not address the convergence of the series in that chapter. Now that we know the series converges for any real number we see that the definition is in fact valid.        Assuming that we can differentiate this series term by term it is straightforward to show that . (We can, but that proof will have to wait for .)  If term by term differentiation is valid we can use Taylor s formula to show that more elegantly than the rather cumbersome proof in equation , as the following problem shows.     Expand about using the Taylor series expansion to show that .     is a nice first step toward a rigorous theory of the convergence of Taylor series, but it is not applicable in all cases. For example, consider the function . As we saw in , the Maclaurin (binomial) series for appears to be converging to the function for . While this is true, the above proposition does not apply. We can see this by finding a general formula for the derivatives of as follows. .  Notice that .  Since this sequence grows without bound as , there is no bound for all of the derivatives of on any interval containing and , and so the hypothesis of will never be satisfied on an interval containing zero. We need a more delicate argument to prove that is valid for . To accomplish that task, we will need to express the remainder of the Taylor series differently. Fortunately there are at least two more forms the remainder available.  "

Lagrange, Joseph-Louis In Lagrange s day, these were taken to be obviously true for a continuous function and we have followed Lagrange s lead by assuming the IVT and the EVT .

First, we assumed the Extreme Value Theorem : Any continuous function on a closed bounded interval assumes its maximum and minimum somewhere on the interval. Second, we assumed that any continuous function satisfied the Intermediate Value Theorem : If a continuous function takes on two different values, then it must take on any value between those two values.  Mathematicians in the late s and early s typically considered these facts to be intuitively obvious. This was natural since our understanding of continuity at that time was solely intuitive. Intuition is a useful tool but as we have seen before it is also unreliable. For example consider the following function .  Is this function continuous at ? Near zero its graph looks like this:     The graph of near .      It is impossible to show in the sketch but this graph oscillates infinitely often as nears zero.  No matter what your guess may be, it is clear that it is hard to analyze such a function armed with only an intuitive notion of continuity. We will revisit this example in the next chapter.  As with convergence, continuity is more subtle than it first appears.  We put convergence on solid ground by providing a completely analytic definition in the previous chapter. What we need to do in the next chapter is provide a completely rigorous definition for continuity.  "

  "title": "An Analytic Definition of Continuity",
  "body": " An Analytic Definition of Continuity  Before the invention of Calculus, the notion of continuity was treated intuitively if it was treated at all. This was reasonable because at first pass it seems to be a very simple idea based solidly in our experience of the real world. Standing on the bank we see a river flow past us continuously, not by tiny jerks. Even when the flow might seem at first to be discontinuous, as when it drops precipitously over a cliff, a closer examination shows that it really is not. As the water approaches the cliff it speeds up. When it finally goes over it accelerates very quickly but no matter how fast it goes it moves continuously, moving from here to there by occupying every point in between. This is continuous motion. It never disappears over there and instantaneously reappears over here. That would be discontinuous motion.  Similarly, a thrown stone flies continuously (and smoothly) from release point to landing point, passing through each point in its path.  But wait.  If the stone passes through discrete points it must be doing so by teeny tiny little jerks, mustn t it? Otherwise how would it get from one point to the next? Is it possible that motion in the real world, much like motion in a movie, is really composed of tiny jerks from one point to the next but that these tiny jerks are simply too small and too fast for our senses to detect?  If so, then the real world is more like the rational number line ( ) from than the real number line ( ). In that case, motion really consists of jumping discretely over the missing points (like ) as we move from here to there. That may seem like a bizarre idea to you it does to us as well but the idea of continuous motion is equally bizarre. It s just a little harder to see why since it is so familiar.  The real world will be what it is regardless of what we believe it to be, but fortunately in mathematics we are not constrained to live in it. So we won t even try. We will simply postulate that no such jerkiness exists; that all motion is continuous.  However we are constrained to live with the logical consequences of our assumptions, once they are made. These will lead us into some very deep waters indeed.  The intuitive treatment of continuity was maintained throughout the 1700 s as it was not generally perceived that a truly rigorous definition was necessary. Consider the following definition given by Euler in 1748.   A continuous curve is one such that its nature can be expressed by a single function of If a curve is of such a nature that for its various parts . . . different functions of are required for its expression, . . . , then we call such a curve discontinuous.   However, the complexities associated with Fourier series and the types of functions that they represented caused mathematicians in the early s to rethink their notions of continuity. As we saw in , the graph of the function defined by the Fourier series looked like this:   Graph of       This function went against Euler s notion of what continuous functions should be. Here, an infinite sum of continuous cosine curves provided a single expression which resulted in a discontinuous curve. But as we ve seen this didn t happen with power series and an intuitive notion of continuity is inadequate to explain the difference. Even more perplexing is the following situation. Intuitively, one would think that a continuous curve should have a tangent line at at least one point. It may have a number of jagged points to it, but it should be smooth somewhere. An example of this would be . Its graph is given by   Graph of .   A curve coming down from the left and from the right to a sharp corner at the origin.    This function is not differentiable at the origin but it is differentiable everywhere else. One could certainly come up with examples of functions which fail to be differentiable at any number of points but, intuitively, it would be reasonable to expect that a continuous function should be differentiable somewhere . We might conjecture the following:    If is continuous on an interval then there is some , such that exists.     Weierstrass, Karl Surprisingly, in , Karl Weierstrass (1815 1897) showed that the above conjecture is FALSE . He did this by displaying the counterexample: .    Karl Weierstrass  Weierstrass, Karl portrait of  Portraits Weierstrass   Portrait of Karl Weierstrass    Weierstrass showed that if is an odd integer, , and , then is continuous everywhere, but is nowhere differentiable. Such a function is somewhat fractal in nature, and it is clear that a definition of continuity relying on intuition is inadequate to study it.   Weierstrass, Karl continuous, everywhere non-differentiable function  continuity Weierstrass continuous, but non-differentiable function    Given , what is the smallest value of for which satisfies Weierstrass criterion to be continuous and nowhere differentiable.      Let and use a computer algebra system to plot for and .      Plot for , where . Based upon what you see in parts b and c, why would we describe the function to be somewhat fractal in nature?     Just as it was important to define convergence with a rigorous definition without appealing to intuition or geometric representations, it is imperative that we define continuity in a rigorous fashion not relying on graphs.   Bolzano, Bernhard The first definition of continuity which did not rely on geometry or intuition was given in 1817 by Bernhard Bolzano (1781 1848) in a paper published in the Proceedings of the Prague Scientific Society entitled Rein analytischer Beweis des Lehrsatzes dass zwieschen je zwey Werthen, die ein entgegengesetztes Resultat gewaehren, wenigstens eine reele Wurzel der Gleichung liege (Purely Analytic Proof of the Theorem that Between Any Two Values that Yield Results of Opposite Sign There Will be at Least One Real Root of the Equation).   Bernhard Bolzano  Bolzano, Bernhard portrait of  Portraits Bolzano   Portrait of Bernhard Bolzano    From the title it should be clear that in this paper Bolzano is proving the Intermediate Value Theorem . To do this he needs a completely analytic definition of continuity. The substance of Bolzano s idea is that if is continuous at a point then should be close to  whenever is close enough to  . More precisely, Bolzano said that is continuous at provided can be made smaller than any given quantity provided we make sufficiently small.   Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm The language Bolzano uses is very similar to the language Leibniz used when he postulated the existence of infinitesimally small numbers. Leibniz said that infinitesimals are smaller than any given quantity but not zero. Bolzano says that can be made smaller than any given quantity provided we make sufficiently small. But Bolzano stops short of saying that is infinitesimally small. He says that given , we can choose so that is smaller than any real number we could name, say , provided we name first. But for any given choice of , , and are both still real numbers. Possibly very small real numbers to be sure, but real numbers nonetheless. Infinitesimals have no place in Bolzano s construction.   Bolzano, Bernhard  Cauchy, Augustin Bolzano s paper was not well known when Cauchy proposed a similar definition in his Cours d analyse of 1821 so it is usually Cauchy who is credited with this definition, but even Cauchy s definition is not quite tight enough for modern standards. It was Karl Weierstrass in 1859 who finally gave the modern definition.   Continuity at a Point  continuity at a point  Definition continuity at a point   We say that a function is continuous at the point provided that for each , there exists a such that if then .     continuity on an interval Notice that the definition of continuity of a function is done point by point so a function can certainly be continuous at some points while discontinuous at others. When we say that is continuous on an interval , then we mean that it is continuous at every point of that interval and, in theory, we would need to use the above definition to check continuity at each individual point.   Extreme Value Theorem (EVT) continuity and  continuity Extreme Value Theorem (EVT) and  Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) continuity and  continuity Intermediate Value Theorem and Our definition fits the bill in that it does not rely on either intuition or graphs, but it is this very non-intuitiveness that makes it hard to grasp. It usually takes some time to become comfortable with this definition, let alone use it to prove theorems such as the Extreme Value Theorem and Intermediate Value Theorem . So let s go slowly to develop a feel for it.  This definition spells out a completely black and white procedure: you give me a positive number , and I must be able to find a positive number which satisfies a certain property. If I can always do that then the function is continuous at the point of interest.  This definition also makes very precise what we mean when we say that should be close to  whenever is close enough to  . For example, intuitively we know that should be continuous at . This means that we should be able to get to within, say, of provided we make close enough to . Specifically, we want . This happens exactly when . Using the fact that and , then we can see that if we get to within of , then and so will be within . of . This is very straightforward. What makes this situation more difficult is that we must be able to do this for any .  Notice the similarity between this definition and the definition of convergence of a sequence. Both definitions have the challenge of an . In the definition of , we had to get to within of by making large enough. For sequences, the challenge lies in making sufficiently small. More precisely, given we need to decide how large should be to guarantee that .  In our definition of continuity, we still need to make something small (namely ), only this time, we need to determine how close must be to to ensure this will happen instead of determining how large must be.  What makes continuous at is the arbitrary nature of (as long as it is positive). As becomes smaller, this forces to be closer to . That we can always find a positive distance to work is what we mean when we say that we can make as close to as we wish, provided we get close enough to . The sequence of pictures below illustrates that the phrase for any , there exists a such that if then can be replaced by the equivalent formulation for any , there exists a such that if then . This could also be replaced by the phrase for any , there exists a such that if then . All of these equivalent formulations convey the idea that we can get to within of , provided we make within of , and we will use whichever formulation suits our needs in a particular application.                  The precision of the definition is what allows us to examine continuity without relying on pictures or vague notions such as nearness or getting closer to. We will now consider some examples to illustrate this precision.    Use the definition of continuity to show that is continuous at any point .    If we were to draw the graph of this function, then you would likely say that this is obvious. The point behind the definition is that we can back up your intuition in a rigorous manner.   Let . Let . If , then    Take particular note in these proofs that our choice of guarantees that . This is obvious now. But as things become more complicated for example, see  it will be easy to chose a that could be equal to zero which will invalidate the proof.  Also, the goal is to write clearly and concisely, but it is better to be clear and a little verbose than to be so concise that your meaning is hidden. So when writing proofs this delicate it is important to take great care to be very clear. If there is any possible ambiguity it is better to state explicitly that, for example, , rather than leaving it to the reader to figure out.   Thus by the definition, is continuous at .    continuity is continuous everywhere   Use the definition of continuity to show that if and are fixed (but unspecified) real numbers then the function is continuous at every real number .     continuity of at zero   Use the definition of continuity to show that is continuous at .     Let . Let . If , then . Thus .  Thus by the definition, is continuous at .   Notice that in these proofs, the challenge of an was given first. This is because the choice of must depend upon . Also notice that there was no explanation for our choice of . We just supplied it and showed that it worked. As long as , then this is all that is required. In point of fact, the we chose in each example was not the only choice that worked; any smaller would work as well.   continuity smaller works in definition  continuity larger works in definition    Given a particular in the definition of continuity, show that if a particular satisfies the definition, then any with will also work for this .      Show that if a can be found to satisfy the conditions of the definition of continuity for a particular , then this will also work for any with .     It wasn t explicitly stated in the definition but when we say if then , we should be restricting ourselves to values which are in the domain of the function , otherwise doesn t make sense. We didn t put it in the definition because that definition was complicated enough without this technicality. Also in the above examples, the functions were defined everywhere so it was a moot point. We will continue with the convention that when we say if then , we will be restricting ourselves to values which are in the domain of the function . This will allow us to examine continuity of functions not defined for all without restating this restriction each time.     continuity is continuous at zero Use the definition of continuity to show that is continuous at .     is continuous at zero   Use the definition of continuity to show that is continuous at . How is this problem different from ? How is it similar?    Sometimes the that will work for a particular is fairly obvious to see, especially after you ve gained some experience. This is the case in the above examples (at least after looking back at the proofs). However, finding is usually not so obvious and requires some scrapwork. This scrapwork is vital toward producing a , but again is not part of the polished proof. This can be seen in the following example.    Use the definition of continuity to prove that is continuous at .   SCRAPWORK   As before, the scrapwork for these problems often consists of simply working backwards. Specifically, given an , we need to find a so that , whenever . We work backwards from what we want, keeping an eye on the fact that we can control the size of . .  This seems to suggest that we should make . We re now ready for the formal proof.     Let . Let . If , then , and so .  Thus by definition, is continuous at .   Bear in mind that someone reading the formal proof will not have seen the scrapwork, so the choice of might seem rather mysterious. However, you are in no way bound to motivate this choice of and usually you should not, unless it is necessary for the formal proof. All you have to do is find this and show that it works. To a trained reader, your ideas will come through when you demonstrate that your choice of works.   Paul Halmos  Halmos, Paul portrait of  Portraits Halmos   Portrait of Paul Halmos     Halmos, Paul Now reverse this last statement. As a trained reader, when you read the proof of a theorem it is your responsibility to find the scrapwork, to see how the proof works and understand it fully. As the renowned mathematical expositor Paul Halmos (1916-2006) said,    Don t just read it; fight it! Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true? What happens in the classical special case? What about the degenerate cases? Where does the proof use the hypothesis?    This is the way to learn mathematics. It is really the only way.   is continuous at every positive real number   Use the definition of continuity to show that is continuous at any positive real number .     is continuous for    Use a unit circle to show that for , and and conclude and for  .

Show that is continuous at any point .    Rewrite as and use what you proved in part a.     In the above problems, we used the definition of continuity to verify our intuition about the continuity of familiar functions. The advantage of this analytic definition is that it can be applied when the function is not so intuitive. Consider, for example, the function given at the end of the last chapter. .  Near zero, the graph of looks like this:     As we mentioned in the previous chapter, since sin oscillates infinitely often as nears zero this graph must be viewed with a certain amount of suspicion. However our completely analytic definition of continuity shows that this function is, in fact, continuous at 0.   Topologist s sine function is continuous at zero   Use the definition of continuity to show that is continuous at .    Even more perplexing is the function defined by         To the naked eye, the graph of this function looks like the lines and . Of course, such a graph would not be the graph of a function. Actually, both of these lines have holes in them. Wherever there is a point on one line there is a hole on the other. Each of these holes is the width of a single point (that is, their width is zero!) so they are invisible to the naked eye (or even magnified under the most powerful microscope available). This idea is illustrated in the following graph     Can such a function so full of holes actually be continuous anywhere? It turns out that we can use our definition to show that this function is, in fact, continuous at and at no other point.   continuity  of using the definition     Use the definition of continuity to show that the function is continuous at .

  "body": " Sequences and Continuity  There is an alternative way to prove that the function is not continuous at . We will examine this by looking at the relationship between our definitions of convergence and continuity. The two ideas are actually quite closely connected, as illustrated by the following very useful theorem.   continuity and sequences   The function is continuous at if and only if satisfies the following property:      says that in order for to be continuous, it is necessary and sufficient that any sequence converging to must force the sequence to converge to . A picture of this situation is below though, as always, the formal proof will not rely on the diagram.           This theorem is especially useful for showing that a function is not continuous at a point . All we need to do is exhibit a sequence converging to such that the sequence does not converge to . Let s demonstrate this idea before we tackle the proof of .    Use to prove that is not continuous at .     First notice that can be written as .  To show that is not continuous at , all we need to do is create a single sequence which converges to , but for which the sequence does not converge to . For a function like this one, just about any sequence will do, but let s use , just because it is an old familiar friend.  We have , but . Thus by , is not continuous at .    continuity Heaviside s function is not continuous at zero   Use to show that is not continuous at , no matter what value is.      continuity  of using sequences    Use to show that is continuous at .     Topologist s Sine Curve  Topologist s sine function modified version is not continuous at zero   The function is often called the topologist s sine curve. Whereas has roots at , and oscillates infinitely often as , has roots at , and oscillates infinitely often as approaches zero. A rendition of the graph follows.     Notice that is not even defined at . We can extend to be defined at by simply choosing a value at . Since this will be a new function we give it a new name. .  Use to show that is not continuous at , no matter what value is chosen for .     Sketch of the Proof of  We ve seen how we can use , now we need to prove it.  The forward direction is fairly straightforward. We assume that is continuous at and start with a sequence which converges to . We now need to show is that , but that will follow from the definitions of  continuity at ,   , and   .    To prove the converse, it is convenient to prove its contrapositive. That is, we want to prove that if is not continuous at then we can construct a sequence that converges to but does not converge to .  First we need to recognize what it means for to not be continuous at . It means that somewhere there exists an , such that no choice of will work for that . More formally, for any such , there will exist , such that   This means that if , then there will exist an such that , but . Similarly, if , then there will exist an such that , but . If we continue in this fashion, we will create a sequence such that , but . This should do the trick.      continuity via sequences  limit and sequences Turn the ideas of the previous two paragraphs into a formal proof of .     is a very useful result. It is a bridge between the ideas of convergence and continuity so it allows us to bring all of the theory we developed in to bear on continuity questions. For example consider the following.   continuous functions sum of continuous functions is continuous  continuity of a sum   Suppose and are both continuous at . Then and are continuous at .     We could use the definition of continuity to prove , but makes our job much easier. For example, to show that is continuous, consider any sequence which converges to . Since is continuous at , then by , . Likewise, since is continuous at , then .  By of ,  Thus by , is continuous at . The proof that is continuous at is similar.    continuous functions the product of continuous functions is continuous  continuity of a product   Use to show that if and are continuous at , then is continuous at .    By employing a finite number of times, we can see that a finite sum of continuous functions is continuous. That is, if are all continuous at then is continuous at . But what about an infinite sum? Specifically, suppose are all continuous at . Consider the following argument.  Let . Since is continuous at , then there exists such that if , then . Let min . If , then  .  Thus by  is continuous at .  This argument seems to say that an infinite sum of continuous functions must be continuous (provided it converges). However we know that the Fourier series is a counterexample as it is an infinite sum of continuous functions which does not converge to a continuous function. Something fundamental seems to have gone wrong here. Can you tell what it is?  This is a question we will spend considerable time addressing in (in particular, see ) so if you don t see the difficulty, don t worry, you will. In the meantime keep this problem tucked away in your consciousness. It is, as we said, fundamental.   will also handle quotients of continuous functions. There is however a small detail that needs to be addressed first. Obviously, when we consider the continuity of at , we need to assume that . However, may be zero at other values. How do we know that when we choose our sequence converging to that is not zero? This would mess up our idea of using the corresponding theorem for sequences ( from ). This can be handled with the following lemma.    If is continuous at and , then there exists such that for all .     continuous functions if is continuouse and then is bounded away from zero near a  continuity of a quotient   Prove .    Consider the case where . Use the definition with . The picture is below; make it formal.     For the case , consider the function .    A consequence of this lemma is that if we start with a sequence converging to , then for sufficiently large, .   continuous functions the quotient of continuous functions is continuous   Use , to prove that if and are continuous at and , then is continuous at .     continuous functions the composition of continuous functions is continuous  continuity of a composition   Suppose is continuous at and is continuous at . Then is continuous at (Note that .)     continuous functions the composition of continuous functions is continuous  continuity of a composition   Prove      Using the definition of continuity.      Using .     The above theorems allow us to build continuous functions from other continuous functions. For example, knowing that and are continuous, we can conclude that any polynomial, is continuous as well. We also know that functions such as are continuous without having to rely on the definition.   continuity drill problems   Show that each of the following is a continuous function at every point in its domain.     Any polynomial.      Any rational function. (A rational function is defined to be a ratio of polynomials.)       .

For example, since is continuous at any point and , then . This also illustrates a certain way of thinking about continuous functions. They are the ones where we can commute the function and a limit of a sequence. Specifically, if is continuous at and , then .   continuity   Compute the following limits. Be sure to explain how continuity is involved.                         Recall that Bolzano s motivation for providing an analytic definition of continuity was to prove the Intermediate Value Theorem . We were motivated by the fact that we used the Intermediate Value Theorem and the Extreme Value Theorem in the derivation of Lagrange s and Cauchy s forms of the remainder for Taylor Series. Without rigorous proofs of these, we have a gap in our understanding of convergence of a Taylor series. In the next chapter, we will close that gap. In doing so we will also need to explore the differences between the rational number system and the real number system that we introduced in .       "

  "title": "The Nested Interval Property: Completeness of the Real Number System",
  "body": " The Nested Interval Property: Completeness of the Real Number System  In deriving the Lagrange and Cauchy forms of the remainder for Taylor series, we made use of the Extreme Value Theorem ( EVT ) and Intermediate Value Theorem ( IVT ). In , we produced an analytic definition of continuity that we can use to prove these theorems. Before we can work out the rest of the tools needed for those proofs we need to explore the make up of the real number system.  To illustrate what we mean, suppose that we have only the rational number system available. We can still use our definition of continuity and can still consider continuous functions such as .     Notice that is a value that lies between and so the IVT says that somewhere between and , must take on the value . That is, there must exist some number such that . You might say, Big deal! Everyone knows works.   However, we are only working with rational numbers and  is not rational. As we saw in the rational number system has holes in it, whereas the real number system doesn't. Again, Big deal! Let's just say that the real number system contains (square) roots.   This sounds reasonable and it actually works for square roots, but consider the function . We know this is a continuous function (Why?). We also know that and . Thus according to the IVT , there should be some number , where . The graph of is shown below.     The situation is not as transparent as before. What is this mysterious where the curve crosses the axis? Somehow we need to convey the idea that the real number system is a continuum, that it is complete . That is, it has no holes in it.  How about this? Why don t we just assume that it has no holes in it? Sometimes the simplest answer works best! We could do that. More complicated statements have been taken as axioms in the past. But how are we going to formulate a rigorous proof based on the statement, There are no holes in the real numbers ?  Also, going back to the Greeks (and possibly further) the thrust of mathematics has always been to keep our axioms as simple and self evident as possible and to prove more complicated statements from the axioms. If possible. So we d prefer to make a simpler assumption (axiom) and use it to show that there are no holes in the real numbers.  We will see that there are several different, but equivalent assumptions we can make that will convey the notion of completeness . We will explore some of them in this chapter. For now we adopt the following as our Completeness Axiom for the real number system.   Nested Interval Property of the Real Number System (NIP)  Completeness Axiom, (the NIP)   Suppose we have two sequences of real numbers and satisfying the following conditions:      (this says that the sequence, , is non-decreasing)     (this says that the sequence, , is non-increasing)      ,           Then there exists a unique number such that for all .    Geometrically, we have the following situation.     Notice that we have two sequences and , one increasing (really non-decreasing) and one decreasing (non-increasing). These sequences do not pass each other. In fact, the following is true:   Nested Interval Property endpoints   Let be sequences as in the NIP . Show that for all , .    They are also coming together in the sense that . The NIP says that in this case there is a unique real number in the middle of all of this: for all .     If there was no such then there would be a hole where these two sequences come together. The NIP guarantees that there is no such hole. We do not need to prove this since an axiom is, by definition, a self evident truth. We are taking it on faith that the real number system has this property. The next problem shows that the completeness property distinguishes the real number system from the rational number system.   Least Upper Bound Property implies the existence of irrational numbers    Find two sequences of rational numbers and which satisfy all four conditions of the NIP and such that there is no rational number satisfying the conclusion of the NIP .    Consider the decimal expansion of an irrational number.      Find two sequences of rational numbers and which satisfy all four conditions of the NIP and such that there is a rational number satisfying the conclusion of the NIP .     You might find the name Nested Interval Property to be somewhat curious since it doesn t explicitly identify any intervals as such. But in light of it should be clear that the sequences and are the left and right endpoints of a set of nested intervals , whose lengths are shrinking to . The conclusion says that the intersection of these intervals is non empty and in fact, consists of a single point. That is, it says .  Intuitively, the sequences and in the NIP appear to converge to . This is in fact, true and can be proven rigorously. This will prove to be a valuable piece of information for us.   Nested Interval Property endpoints  limit of interval endpoints in the NIP   Suppose that we have two sequences and satisfying all of the assumptions of the Nested Interval Property. If is the unique number such that for all , then .     Nested Interval Property endpoints   Prove .    To illustrate the idea that the NIP plugs the holes in the real line, we will prove the existence of square roots of nonnegative real numbers.   square roots exist   Suppose . There exists a real number such that .    Notice that we can't just say, Let , since the idea is to show that this square root exists. In fact, throughout this proof, we cannot really use a square root symbol as we haven't yet proved that square roots exist. The idea behind the proof illustrates how the NIP is used in practice.   Sketch of Proof  Our strategy is to construct two sequences which will narrow in on the number that we seek. Observe that we need to find a number such that and a number such that . (Remember that we can't say and since our goal is to show that exists.) There are many possibilities, but how about and You can check that these will satisfy  . Furthermore . This is the starting point.  The technique we will employ is often called a bisection technique, and is a useful way to set ourselves up for applying the NIP . Let be the midpoint of the interval . Then either we have or . In the case , we really want to take the place of since it is larger than , but still represents an underestimate for what would be the square root of . This thinking prompts the following move. If , we will relabel things by letting and . The situation looks like this on the number line.     In the other case where , we will relabel things by letting and . The situation looks like this on the number line.     In either case, we've reduced the length of the interval where the square root lies to half the size it was before. Stated in more specific terms, in either case we have the same results:   Now we play the same game, but instead we start with the interval . Let be the midpoint of . Then we have or . If , we relabel and . If , we relabel and . In either case, we end up with    Continuing in this manner, will produce two sequences, and satisfying the following conditions:   Condition 1:       Condition 2:       Condition 3:    ,     Condition 4:       Condition 5:  These sequences also satisfy the following property:      Conditions 1 through 4 tell us that and satisfy all of the conditions of the NIP , so we can conclude that there must exist a real number such that for all . At this point, you should be able to use Condition 5. to show that as desired.    Nested Interval Property square roots of integers, and  Nested Interval Property implies the existence of square roots of integers   Turn the above outline into a formal proof of .    The bisection method we employed to prove is also pretty typical of how we will use the NIP , as it ensures that we will create a sequence of nested intervals with meet all of the conditions specified in the NIP . We will employ this strategy in the proofs of the IVT and EVT . Deciding how to relabel the endpoints of our intervals will be determined by what we want to do with these two sequences of real numbers. This will typically lead to a fifth property, which will be crucial in proving that the guaranteed by the NIP does what we want it to do. Specifically, in the above example, we always wanted our candidate for to be in the interval . This judicious choice led to the extra Condition 5:  . In applying the NIP to prove the IVT and EVT , Condition 5 is what will change based on the property we want to have.   series Harmonic Series slow divergence of Before we tackle the IVT and EVT , let s use the NIP to address an interesting question about the Harmonic Series. Recall that the Harmonic Series, , grows without bound. That is, . The question is how slowly does this series grow? For example, how many terms would it take before the series surpasses 100? Or 1000? Or 10000?   Euler, Leonhard Leonhard Euler decided to tackle this problem in the following way. He decided to consider the . This limit is called Euler's constant and is traditionally denoted by . Equation says that for very large values of , we have . If we could approximate , then we could replace the inequality with the more tractable inequality ln  and solve for in this. This should tell us roughly how many terms would need to be added in the Harmonic Series to surpass 100. Approximating with a computer is not too bad. We could make as large as we wish in ln to make closer approximations for . The real issue is, how do we know that actually exists? As of the time we are writing this book it is not even known if is rational or irrational. So in our opinion, the existence of this limit is not obvious. And even if it were, a formal proof would be required.  We will use the NIP to show that this limit does in fact exist. The details are in the following problem.   Euler, Leonhard Euler's constant existence of             Let . Use the following diagram to show          Let . Use a similar diagram to show that .      Let . Show that and satisfy the hypotheses of the nested interval property and use the NIP to conclude that there is a real number such that for all .      Conclude that .                 Euler, Leonhard Euler's constant slow convergence to    Use the inequality for all to approximate to three decimal places.      Use the fact that for large , to determine approximately how large must be to make .      Suppose we have a supercomputer which can add trillion terms of the Harmonic Series per second. Approximately how many times the current age of the Earth would it take for this computer to sum the Harmonic Series until it surpasses ?     "

  "title": "The Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem",
  "body": " The Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem  The Intermediate Value Theorem followed pretty readily once we introduced the Nested Interval Property . The proof of Extreme Value Theorem takes a bit more work. First we need the result of below.   continuous functions continuous function on a closed, bounded interval is bounded   A continuous function defined on a closed, bounded interval must be bounded. That is, let be a continuous function defined on . Then there exists a positive real number such that for all .     Sketch of Alleged Proof: Let's assume, for contradiction, that there is no such bound . This says that for any positive integer , there must exist such that . (Otherwise would be a bound for .)   IF the sequence converges to, say , then we would have our contradiction. Indeed, we would have , and by the continuity of at and we would have which implies that the sequence converges. So by the sequence must be bounded. This would provide our contradiction since, by construction , for all positive integers . QED?   This would work well except for one little problem. The way it was constructed, there is no reason to expect the sequence to converge to anything That is why we emphasized the IF above. Fortunately, this idea can be salvaged. While it is true that the sequence may not converge, part of it will. We will need the following definition.   sequences subsequences  subsequences  Definition subsequences   Let be a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers; that is, . If is a sequence, then is called a subsequence of .    The idea is that a subsequence of a sequence is a part of the sequence, , which is itself a sequence. However, it is a little more restrictive. We can choose any term in our sequence to be part of the subsequence, but once we choose that term, we can't go backwards. This is where the condition comes in. For example, suppose we started our subsequence with the term . We could not choose our next term to be . The subscript of the next term would have to be greater than 100. In fact, the thing about a subsequence is that it is all in the subscripts; we are really choosing a subsequence of the sequence of subscripts in .   sequences subsequences   Given the sequence , the following are subsequences.                    itself.      sequences not subsequences   The following are NOT subsequences.                         The subscripts in the examples we have seen so far have a discernable pattern, but this need not be the case. For example, would be a subsequence as long as the subscripts form an increasing sequence themselves.   sequences all subsequences of a convergent sequence converge   Suppose . Prove that for any subsequence of .    First prove that .     Bolzano, Bernhard  Weierstrass, Karl A very important theorem about subsequences was introduced by Bernhard Bolzano and was later proven independently by Karl Weierstrass. Basically, this theorem says that any bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence.   The Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem  Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem  BWT Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem   Let be a sequence of real numbers such that ,  . Then there exists and a subsequence , such that .    As an example of this theorem, consider the sequence .  This sequence does not converge, but the subsequence converges to . This is not the only convergent subsequence. For example, the subsequence also converges to . Notice that if the sequence is unbounded, then all bets are off. The sequence may have a convergent subsequence or it may not. The sequences represent these possibilities as the first contains for example, the convergent subsequence and all subsequences of the the second diverge to infinity.  The Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem says that no matter how the sequence is produced, as long as it is bounded then it contains a convergent subsequence. This can be very useful. In particular the sequence that appears in our Alleged Proof is bounded since . So it contains a convegent subsequence.   Sketch of a Proof of the Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem  Suppose we have our sequence such that ,  , as in the Alleged Proof above. To find our for the subsequence to converge to we will use the NIP . Since we are already using as our original sequence, we will need to use different letters in setting ourselves up for the NIP . With this in mind, let and , and notice that for infinitely many . (This is, in fact true for all , but you'll see why we said it the way we did.) Let be the midpoint of and notice that either for infinitely many or for infinitely many . If for infinitely many , then we relabel and . If for infinitely many , then relabel and . In either case, we get , , and for infinitely many .  Now we consider the interval and let be the midpoint of . Since for infinitely many , then either for infinitely many or for infinitely many . If for infinitely many , then we relabel and .

Since for infinitely many , choose an integer such that . (Notice that to make a subsequence it is crucial that , and this is why we needed to insist that for infinitely many .)

  "body": " The Supremum and the Extreme Value Theorem   says that a continuous function on a closed, bounded interval must be bounded. Boundedness, in and of itself, does not ensure the existence of a maximum or minimum. We must also have a closed, bounded interval. To illustrate this, consider the continuous function tan defined on the (unbounded) interval .     This function is bounded between and , but it does not attain a maximum or minimum as the lines are horizontal asymptotes. Notice that if we restricted the domain to a closed, bounded interval then it would attain its extreme values on that interval (as guaranteed by the EVT ).  To find a maximum we need to find the smallest possible upper bound for the range of the function. This prompts the following definitions.   Upper Bound  Definition Upper Bound   Let and let be a real number. We say that is an upper bound of provided for all .    For example, if , then any with would be an upper bound of . Furthermore, the fact that is not an element of the set is immaterial. Indeed, if , then any with would still be an upper bound of . Notice that, in general, if a set has an upper bound, then it has infinitely many since any number larger than that upper bound would also be an upper bound. However, there is something special about the smallest upper bound.   Least Upper Bound Property ( LUBP )  Least Upper Bound Property  Definition Least Upper Bound Property  LUBP Least Upper Bound Property   Let and let be a real number. We say that is the least upper bound of provided      for all . ( is an upper bound of )    If for all , then . (Any upper bound of is at least as big as .)     In this case, we also say that  is the supremum of and we write .    Notice that the definition really says that is the smallest upper bound of . Also notice that the second condition can be replaced by its contrapositive so we can say that if and only if         If then there exists such that .     The second condition says that if a number is less than , then it can't be an upper bound, so that really is the smallest upper bound.  Also notice that the supremum of the set may or may not be in the set itself. This is illustrated by the examples above as in both cases, and . Obviously, a set which is not bounded above such as cannot have a supremum. However, for non-empty sets which are bounded above, we have the following.   The Least Upper Bound Property ( LUBP )  Least Upper Bound Property   Let be a non empty subset of which is bounded above. Then has a supremum.     Sketch of Proof  Since , then there exists . Since is bounded above then it has an upper bound, say . We will set ourselves up to use the Nested Interval Property. With this in mind, let and and notice that  such that (namely, itself) and , .

In either case, we end up with , , and  such that and , . If we continue this process, we end up with two sequences, and , satisfying the following conditions:               ,             such that and , ,     By properties 1 4 and the NIP there exists such that . We will leave it to you to use property 5 to show that .    Nested Interval Property implies the LUBP  NIP Nested Interval Property   Complete the above ideas to provide a formal proof of .    Notice that we really used the fact that was non-empty and bounded above in the proof of . This makes sense, since a set which is not bounded above cannot possibly have a least upper bound. In fact, any real number is an upper bound of the empty set so that the empty set would not have a least upper bound.  The following corollary to can be very useful.    Let be a bounded, increasing sequence of real numbers. That is, . Then converges to some real number .     sequences bounded and non-decreasing   Prove .    Let . To show that , let Note that is not an upper bound. You take it from here!      value of   Consider the following curious expression . We will use to show that this actually converges to some real number. After we know it converges we can actually compute what it is. Of course to do so, we need to define things a bit more precisely. With this in mind consider the following sequence defined as follows:  .     Use induction to show that for .      Use the result from part (a) to show that for .      From , we have that must converge to some number . Use the fact that must converge to as well to compute what must be.

Extreme Value Theorem (EVT)  Extreme Value Theorem (EVT)   Suppose is continuous on . Then there exists such that , for all .     Sketch of Proof  We will first show that attains its maximum. To this end, recall that tells us that is a bounded set. By the LUBP , must have a least upper bound which we will label , so that . This says that ,for all . All we need to do now is find a with . With this in mind, notice that since , then for any positive integer , is not an upper bound of . Thus there exists with . Now, by the Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem , has a convergent subsequence converging to some . Using the continuity of at , you should be able to show that . To find the minimum of , find the maximum of .    Extreme Value Theorem (EVT)   Formalize the above ideas into a proof of the EVT .    Notice that we used the NIP to prove both the Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem and the LUBP . This is really unavoidable, as it turns out that all of those statements are equivalent in the sense that any one of them can be taken as the completeness axiom for the real number system and the others proved as theorems. This is not uncommon in mathematics, as people tend to gravitate toward ideas that suit the particular problem they are working on. In this case, people realized at some point that they needed some sort of completeness property for the real number system to prove various theorems. Each individual's formulation of completeness fit in with his understanding of the problem at hand. Only in hindsight do we see that they were really talking about the same concept: the completeness of the real number system. In point of fact, most modern textbooks use the LUBP as the axiom of completeness and prove all other formulations as theorems. We will finish this section by showing that either the Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem or the LUBP can be used to prove the NIP . This says that they are all equivalent and that any one of them could be taken as the completeness axiom.    Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem  implies the NIP    Use the Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem to prove the NIP . That is, assume that the Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem holds and suppose we have two sequences of real numbers, and , satisfying:                   .     Prove that there is a unique real number such that , for all .    Since the Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem and the Nested Interval Property are equivalent, it follows that the Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem is not true in the rational number system.   sequences find a bounded sequence of rational numbers such that no subsequence converges to a rational number   Find a bounded sequence of rational numbers such that no subsequence of it converges to a rational number.     Least Upper Bound Property implies the Nested Interval Property   Use the Least Upper Bound Property to prove the Nested Interval Property . That is, assume that every non-empty subset of the real numbers which is bounded above has a least upper bound; and suppose that we have two sequences of real numbers and , satisfying:                   .     Prove that there is a unique real number such that , for all n.     might work well here.     Least Upper Bound Property doesn't hold in   Since the LUBP is equivalent to the NIP it does not hold for the rational number system. Demonstrate this by finding a non empty set of rational numbers which is bounded above, but whose supremum is an irrational number.    We now have the machinery in place to prove the Archimedean Property of the real number system as we promised we d to back in . We mentioned in , that until the invention of Calculus this was taken to be intuitively obvious but we can now prove it as a formal theorem. The proof depends on the completeness of the real number system.   Archimedean Property of  The Archimedean Property   Given any positive real numbers and , there exists a positive integer , such that .     Least Upper Bound Property implies the Archimedean Property  Archimedean Property and LUBP   Prove .    Assume that there are positive real numbers and , such that  . Then would be bounded above by . Let and consider .    You might reasonably ask if the Archimedean Property is equivalent to the Least Upper Bound Property (and thus could be taken as an axiom). The answer lies in the following problem.   Archimedean Property and   Does satisfy the Archimedean Property and what does this have to do with the question of taking the Archimedean Property as an axiom of completeness?    "

  "title": "The Definition of the Limit of a Function",
  "body": " The Definition of the Limit of a Function  We ve already used the the notion of a limit and its associated notation, , to analyze the convergence and divergence of a sequence. And you ve almost certainly encountered limits of functions before so it is tempting for us (the authors) to assume that you are already well versed in the limit concept and simply plow forward with little discussion. We won t do that.  And it is probably tempting for you to make the same assumption and skip the discussion you are about to see. Don t do that. The limit concept is subtle. There is more to it than you probably believe and it is worth taking time to think about it deeply.  For example, the statement has a very precise meaning. It means that as increases arbitrarily ( ) the elements of the sequence get arbitrarily close to zero . Notice that it does not mean that is actually equal to zero for any value of . That is not true.  You might reasonably ask, OK, but what exactly is equal to zero? The notation =0 clearly states that something is equal to zero. What? A simple answer to that question is as obvious as it is unhelpful. It is the limit of that is equal to zero.  More helpfully, suppose the sequence converges to . In we usually said that  converged to rather than saying that was equal to . Unfortunately this idea gets rendered notationally as and when we read it aloud we tend to say that  equals rather than converges to . This is not wrong per se but it can be confusing at first. But ultimately it is the limit of the sequence that is equal to , not any individual term, and certainly not the sequence itself.  The limit concept has always been lurking in the background of Calculus. Because it is a deep and very abstract idea it took about years to bring it forward clearly. And as we ve just seen the notation we ve inherited (especially the way the equals sign is used) is more befuddling than helpful, at least at first. We will proceed slowly.                    Newton, Isaac In his attempts to justify his calculations, Newton used what he called his doctrine of Ultimate Ratios . For example, the ratio becomes  ultimately , or at the last instant before becomes zero. Newton would have called an evanescent or vanishing quantity ( , p. 33).       Notice that to evaluate the limit of the sequences and the limit parameters and are different. In the former the limit parameter took on only integer values, whereas in the latter it could be any real number (though we're only interested in values close to zero).        While they are clearly related, the two limits, are different kinds of entities.   Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm Similarly Leibniz differentials (e.g. and ) can be seen as an attempt to get infinitely close to and respectively, in much the same way that does in . Infinite closeness is the idea at the heart of Calculus. Unfortunately it is very difficult to define infinite closeness so to get around that difficulty we instead we ask what happens to the expression as gets arbitrarily close to zero. Which is the meaning of the notation: .   Lagrange, Joseph-Louis  Cauchy, Augustin As we saw in , Lagrange tried to avoid the entire issue of infinite closeness, both in the limit and differential forms when, in 1797, he attempted to make infinite series series the foundational concept in Calculus. Although Lagrange s efforts failed, they set the stage for Cauchy to provide a definition of derivative which in turn relied on his precise formulation of a limit. Consider the following example.   Suppose we wish to determine the slope of the tangent line (derivative) of at . We form the usual difference quotient: . Now consider the graph of this difference quotient .   Graph of      From the graph, it might first appear that but we must be careful. doesn t even exist! Somehow we must convey the idea that will approach as approaches , even though the function is not defined at . Cauchy s idea was that even if is meaningless it must be that because we can make differ from by as little as we wish by taking sufficiently close to zero ( , p. 158).    Weierstrass, Karl  Karl Weierstrass made these ideas precise in his lectures on analysis at the University of Berlin (1859-60) and provided us with our modern formulation of the limit.   Limit  limit  Definition limit   We say provided that for each , there exists a such that if then .    Before we delve into this, notice that is very similar to the definition of continuity at a point .  This is because the two concepts are closely very related.  In fact we can readily see that is continuous at if and only if the limit of as approaches is .   Use and to prove that a function is continuous at if and only if .             There are really only two differences between and and the differences are related. The first is that we in the definition of a limit plays the same role that played in the definition of continuity. This is because the function may not be defined at . In a sense the limiting value is the value would have if it were defined and continuous at .  The second difference is that we have replaced from the continuity definition with in the limit definition. You can see why this change is needed from the limit in . Since is not defined at we need to eliminate that possibility from consideration. This is the only purpose for this change.                                                Consider the function , . You probably recognize this as the difference quotient used to compute the derivative of at , so we strongly suspect that . Just as when we were dealing with limits of sequences, we should be able to use the definition to verify this. And as before, we will start with some scrapwork.   SCRAPWORK   Let . We wish to find a such that if then . With this in mind, we perform the following calculations .  Now we have a handle on that will work in the definition and we ll give the formal proof that .     Let and let . If , then .   As in our previous work with sequences and continuity, notice that the scrapwork is not part of the formal proof (though it was necessary to determine an appropriate . Also, notice that was not really used except to ensure that .   limit   Use the definition of a limit to verify that      limit verifying limits via continuity   Use the definition of a limit to verify each of the following limits.           .                 Our definition of a limit, although it is rigorous, is quite cumbersome to use. What we want to do is develop some tools we can use without having to refer directly to . One such tool is which allows us to show that a function is continuous (or discontinuous) at a point by examining certain sequences. We will need others.  As we observed earlier, is continuous at if and only if . On the other hand if is not continuous at , but , we can make it continuous by arbitrarily assigning .   Combining this with we have the following corollary:                      if and only if satisfies the following property:     Armed with this, we can prove the following familiar limit theorems from Calculus.   limit properties of   Suppose and , then              provided and , for sufficiently close to a (but not equal to ).

  "body": " The Definition of the Derivative and the Mean Value Theorem  As we mentioned in Leibniz invented his calculus differentialis (differential calculus literally rules for (infinitely small) differences ) in the s.  In the late s Lagrange tried to provide a rigorous foundation for Calculus by discarding differential ratios like the expression in favor of his own prime notation ( ). Thus it was Lagrange who established functions and limits, rather than the curves and infinitesimals favored by Leibniz and Newton, as fundamental.  When you took Calculus you spent at least an entire semester learning about the properties of the derivative and how to use them to explore the properties of functions so there is no need to repeat that effort here. Instead we will establish the underlying, rigorous, formal foundation for the derivative concept in terms of limits.   The Derivative  differentiation definition of the derivative  Definition derivative   Given a function defined on an interval we define     There are a few fairly obvious facts about this definition which are nevertheless worth noticing explicitly:    If the limit exists at , then we say that is differentiable at .   The derivative is defined at a point. If the derivative of is defined at every point in an interval then we say that is differentiable on the interval  .    Since it is defined at a point it is at least theoretically possible for a function to be differentiable at a single point in its entire domain.    Since it is defined as a limit and not all limits exist, functions are not necessarily differentiable.    Since it is defined as a limit, applies. That is, exists if and only if , if then . Since this could also be written as .     If we make the substitution in we obtain the following equivalent definition, which is sometimes easier to use.   The Derivative, An Alternative Definition  differentiation definition of the derivative  Definition derivative   Given a function defined on an interval , and a point , the derivative of is given by .     continuity implied by differentiability  differentiation differentiability implies continuity    Differentiability Implies Continuity   If is differentiable at a point then is continuous at as well.     differentiation differentiability implies continuity   Prove     As we mentioned, the derivative is an extraordinarily useful mathematical tool but it is not our intention to learn to use it here. Our purpose here is to define it rigorously (done) and to show that our formal definition does in fact recover the useful properties you came to know and love in your Calculus course.  The first such property is known as Fermat s Theorem.                                                                  Fermat s Theorem  Fermat s Theorem   Suppose is differentiable on and has an extremum at . Then .     Sketch of Proof  There are two cases:   Case 1:   is a maximum, and    Case 2:   is a minimum.     Suppose is a maximum so that for all . Since is differentiable at , we have   To show , we need to show that These facts follow from .  The case where is a minimum can be handled by looking at .     Provide a formal proof for Fermat s Theorem .    Many of the most important properties of the derivative follow from what is called the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) stated below.   The Mean Value Theorem ( MVT )  Mean Value Theorem, the      Suppose exists for every and is continuous on . Then there is a real number such that     It would be difficult to prove the MVT right now, so we will first state and prove Rolle s Theorem, which can be seen as a special case of the MVT. The proof of the MVT will then follow easily.   Newton, Isaac  Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm  Michel Rolle (1652 1719) first stated the following theorem in 1691. Given this date and the nature of the theorem it would be reasonable to suppose that Rolle was one of the early developers of Calculus but this is not so. In fact, Rolle was disdainful of both Newton and Leibniz versions of Calculus, once deriding them as a collection of ingenious fallacies. It is a bit ironic that his theorem is so fundamental to the modern development of the Calculus he ridiculed.   Rolle s Theorem  Rolle s Theorem   Suppose exists for every , is continuous on , and .  Then there is a real number such that .                                                     Sketch of Proof  By the EVT , we know that has a maximum , and a minimum , on . Suppose that both occur at the endpoints. This would say that and is constant on . What does this say about ?  On the other hand, what does Fermat s Theorem say if one or both of these extrema is not at an endpoint?    Rolle s Theorem  Turn the ideas in the sketch above into a proof of Rolle s Theorem .   We can now prove the MVT as a corollary of Rolle s Theorem. We only need to find the right function to apply Rolle s Theorem to. The following figure shows a function, , cut by a secant line, , from to .   A straight line, L(x), and a wavy line f(x), both starting at (a, f(a)) and ending at (b, f(b)). At a point x between a and b the vertical distance between the two lines (from (x, L(x)) to (x, f(x))) is labeled phi(x).   The vertical difference from to the secant line, indicated by in the figure should do the trick. You take it from there.   Mean Value Theorem, the   Prove the Mean Value Theorem .    Notice that the MVT is a generalization of Rolle s Theorem or, put another way, Rolle s Theorem is a special case of the MVT.  The Mean Value Theorem is extraordinarily useful. Almost all of the properties of the derivative that you used in Calculus follow more or less directly from it. For example the following is true.    If for every in the interval then for every where we have .  That is, is increasing on .     Suppose and are as described in the corollary. Then by the Mean Value Theorem there is some number, say such that .

  "title": "The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus",
  "body": " The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus  If you look back at our derivation of the Integral Form of the Remainder for Taylor Series ( ) you ll see that the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provided our anchoring step: .  The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus was understood (in at least the limited context of polynomials) before Newton and Leibniz invented Calculus.     They both provided derivations of it via their versions of Calculus, but again neither of them dubbed it The Fundamental Theorem. That name was an innovation of twentieth century Calculus textbooks. Both Newton and Leibniz considered it very natural and obvious that areas can be found by antidifferentiation.  Using the differential and integral notation that Leibniz invented (and we still use today) it is easy to see why. If we suppose that , then it follows that . Notice that equation states that two differentials are equal. Thus it seems apparent that if we add (integrate) together all such differentials between and we have (again employing Leibniz notation)    Equation indicates that we are summing all of the respective differentials between and .   Integral Notation: Upper and Lower Indices  We said that equation uses Leibniz notation but this is not entirely correct. Fourier innovated the use of upper and lower indices on the integral sign to show the limits of the integration approximately 150 years later. Leibniz didn t use them.   Since a finite sum of finite differences collapses into the difference of the extremes: . Leibniz assumed that this is also true for an infinite sum of infinitesimals. This is probably the most intuitive understanding of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In Leibniz notation it is .  For Leibniz, this is all so natural and obvious that when he wrote about it in his 1693 paper Supplementum geometriae dimensoriae, seu generalissima omnium tetragonismorum effectio per motum: similiterque multiplex constructio lineae ex data tangentium conditione ,    he called it a supplementum (supplement, or corollary) rather than something more imposing like the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus .  Leibniz included a diagram to support this result, but he rather famously favored very complex diagrams in his publications. We provide a simpler, more modern rendition below.   A visual interpretation of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus as it was understood by Leibniz. The relationship between the curves is that the function on the left, , is the derivative of the function on the right, .               In the area of the infinitely thin rectangle on the left is given by and is numerically equal to the infinitely small length on the right. Adding the areas on the left gives the area under the curve between and . The sum of the lengths on the right gives the length of the line segment, also between and : .  Such an approach does not pass modern, or even th century, standards of rigor. Even in the th century it was known that there are logical problems with interpreting an integral in terms of infinitiesimals. But the infinitesimal approach was adequate to the needs of the time so a closer investigation into the nature of the integral was left until infinitesimals were no longer sufficient.   One question which eventually led to such a closer investigation was, Does every continuous function have an antiderivative. What do you think?        At this point we have the tools necessary for a rigorous proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. What we do not have is an adequate definition of the integral.   We ll need a definition that is independent of differentiation, but which recovers all of the properties of integration that you are already familiar with from your Calculus course, including the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.  We ll provide such a definition in (the next section), but since we are already familiar with the properties we ll need we will proceed with the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus now.  The following formulation and proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is from Cauchy s 1823 publication Résumé des leçons donnés à l école royale polytechnique sur le calcul infinitesimal (Summary of the lessons given at the Royal Polytechnic School on infinitesimal calculus).   The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Cauchy)  Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, The  Suppose is continuous on and define   for . Then is continuous on , differentiable on and      Notice that and equation are very closely related though they come at the question of integration from different viewpoints.   Equation starts with the assumption that . It says that if we sum the differentials from to then the sum collapses to the difference of the extremes: .            On the other hand starts with the assumption that is well defined, uses this to define the function ( which is simply by another name), and then concludes where Leibniz began with the statement that , (or ). Our task in the next section will be to provide a definition that will support that conclusion.  In most Calculus texts equation is called a definite integral , and the function defined in is called an indefinite integral . The two of them are often referred to as parts and of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.  We will now proceed with the proof of Cauchy s version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, with the caveat that the proof is not complete until we have defined the function and shown that under our definition it has the properties we expect from an integral. We will need some of these properties in the proof below.   Sketch of Proof  There are two statements to prove:  That is continuous on the closed interval ,  and that is differentiable on the open interval .  We will prove differentiablity on first. From that continuity on follows immediately (why?). Continuity at the endpoints will be addressed separately.  Let . To find we apply . Thus         Since was assumed to be continuous on it is also continuous on the closed interval with endpoints and .

That is, how do we know that actually exists?  "

  "body": " The Definition of the Integral    In a letter to Eratosthenes (circa 250 BC), Archimedes described what he called a mechanical method for finding areas and volumes. His method consisted of mentally dividing objects into infinitely thin slices and balancing these slices on an imaginary balance. Archimedes noted that while his method was not rigorous it was still quite useful:    . . . I thought it might be appropriate to write down for you a special method, by means of which you will be able to recognize certain mathematical questions with the aid of mechanics. I am convinced that this is no less useful than finding the proofs of these same theorems.    Some things, which first became clear to me by the mechanical method, were afterwards proved geometrically, because their investigation by that method does not furnish an actual demonstration. It is easier to supply the proof when we have previously acquired, by the method, some knowledge of the questions than it is to find it without any previous knowledge . . .    Closer to our time Cavalieri , Torricelli , Kepler , Galileo , Roberval , and others explored a similar idea. They too mentally cut geometric areas (and volumes) into infinitely thin slices. But rather than using an imaginary balance they compared them geometrically.  This division of objects into infinitely small pieces in order to analyze them is the essential idea underlying Calculus but as Archimedes observed it is questionable as a method of proof. For practical applicatons this is still a useful way to think.  It had always been recognized that infinitesimals were an inadequate foundation for Calculus but it was at the beginning of the 19th century, in large part due to the work of Fourier, that it became imperative to replace it.  Fourier s work raises the question: How random> can a function defined on an interval be and still be represented by a Fourier series? Since the coefficients are computed via integration, a closely related question is how random can a function be and still be integrable?  Since this text is intended as a one semester introduction to real analysis we will not be able to fully answer that question here. But we will give one rigorous definition of the integral (there are many) and use it to show that a continuous function on a closed interval is integrable. This will close the gap in our proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus .          Cauchy s Integral Definition  One of the first mathematicians to provide a rigorous definition of a definite integral was Augustin Louis Cauchy in 1823. Cauchy used the limit idea to bridge the gap between finite sums of (finitely many) very small (but still finite) pieces and infinite sums of infinitesimals.  It was common practice to approximate an integral whose antiderivative was not readily computable by a finite sum as seen in .        To approximate , Cauchy started by partitioning of the interval into a finite number of subintervals. Basically, the partition is a finite sequence of numbers . In the figure . He then formed the sum   If as in we see that we are approximating the area under the curve with the area of a finite sum of boxes whose bases are the subintervals and whose heights are obtained by evaluating at some point in . In our figure we used the left endpoint for convenience. Notice that the subintervals need not be the same length.  Diagrams like this are the source of the common misunderstanding that an integral computes area. In certain special cases it does, but not always. Yet it is often helpful to think of an integral that way.  We define the norm of the partition to be to be the length of the largest subinterval: . Cauchy said that a function defined on was integrable if there was a number such that for all , there is a such that whenever the norm of the partition, is less than the difference between and the associated sum will be less than . Symbolically this is . Notice that can be any partition as long as .  In this case we write   Using this definition Cauchy was then able to show that any continuous function is (Cauchy) integrable and was able to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus as we indicated in the last section. More formally, Cauchy made the following definition.   The Riemann Integral  Definition Riemann Integral  Riemann Integral   Given a function defined on the interval , we say is integrable on if and only if there is a number such that for each , there is a such that for any partition of with , we have for any choice of where .                     Historical Context  No doubt you are wondering why this is called the Riemann Integral when it was devised by Cauchy.  It often happens in mathematics that important concepts do not get named for the person who invents them. In this instance Cauchy showed that continuous functions are integrable under his definition, but left open the question, Is it necessary for a function to be continuous for it to be integrable?   The answer to that question is emphatically No! as Riemann showed in 1868. In fact Riemann was able to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a function to be integrable under Cauchy s definition which are far weaker than continuity. We won t go into that as it does not serve our purposes here, but as a result of Riemann s work Cauchy s definition of the integral came to be called the Riemann integral .                          The similarity between and the definition of a limit is hard to miss so sometimes the Riemann integral is defined via the limit symbol as but in our (the authors ) opinions this notatation serves to hide the important ideas rather than elucidate them because the limit in equation is very different from the ones we ve encountered before.  In the past, when we had limits like we only had to think about letting the single variable get close to  . But the limit in equation is far more complex. It asks us to simultaneously think about all possible partitions with the property that and what is happening when .  Because of these issues we will use an equivalent formulation of the definite integral. One which makes use of a concepts we ve already familiar with: the least upper bound and greatest lower bound properties of the real number system.        Darboux s Integral Definition  Notice that neither nor the definition of the integral nor the definition of the derivative tells us how to compute the quantity in question. In the 19th century how to compute both integrals and derivatives was as well known as it is today. These definitions are about providing a rigorous foundation for these ideas, not computing them.   Jean Gaston Darboux  Portraits Darboux  Darboux, Jean portrait of      In 1875 Jean Gaston Darboux developed a different (yet equivalent) definition of the Riemann integral which uses the least upper and greatest lower bounds we learned about in . There are discontinuous functions which are Darboux (and Riemann) integrable, but to keep things simple we will restrict our attention to continuous functions.  As before, we will start with a partition of the interval where . Let and denote the minimum and maximum of on , respectively. Define the lower (Darboux) sum by and upper (Darboux) sum by .  Notice that if the integral exists, then it is intuitively clear that It is also intuitively clear that as the number of intervals gets larger, these bounds get closer to the actual integral (again, if it exists). If you don t see this try drawing a few representative examples.   Partition Refinement  partition refinement  Definition partition refinement   Given two partitions and  is said to be a refinement of if every point in is also a point in . That is, .      Show that if is a refinement of , then     First, show that this is true if is obtained by adding one point to .      Let and be any two partitions of . Show that     Consider that is a refinement of both and , and use the previous result.    Next observe that the set of lower sums over all partitions of is a non empty set of real numbers which is bounded above. Therefore by it has a least upper bound. We define the lower (Darboux) integral by   Similarly, the set of all upper sums is a non empty set of real numbers which is bounded below and therefore has a greatest lower bound. We define the upper (Darboux) integral as the greatest lower bound of this set     Show that     Let be a fixed partition of . By , is an upper bound for the set of all lower sums. This says .  However, is an arbitrary partition of .]     Darboux Integrability  Darboux Integrability  Definition Darboux Integrability   A function is said to be (Darboux) integrable provided   In this case we define the (Darboux) integral by     We have restricted our attention to continuous functions so that in the definitions of the upper and lower sums we could ensure that on each subinterval the function in question has a minimum and a maximum , per the Extreme Value Theorem . By tweaking a bit it is possible to extend integrability to some discontinuous functions, but not all of them. For example a slight modification of either Cauchy s or Darboux s definition of the Riemann integral will allow us to include the step function: but we will not pursue these extensions any further.  The next problem displays a function invented by Lejeune Dirichlet (1805 1859) in 1837 which is not Riemann integrable.       Lejeune Dirichlet  Portraits Dirichelet  Dirichelet, Lejeune portrait of   Portrait of Dirichlet      In honor of Dirichlet his function is often denoted . It is defined as follows: .  Show that is not Riemann integrable on .    Use Darboux s definition of the Riemann integral.    As we mentioned earlier, Darboux s definition of the integral is equivalent to the Riemann integral, in the sense that any function which is Riemann integrable is also Darboux integral and vice versa . This is similar to having both an analytic definition of continuity and a sequence based definition of continuity . We can use whichever definition works better for the problem at hand.  For example, it is straightforward to derive the properties of definite integrals that you learned in Calculus using Cauchy s formulation. But to show that a continuous function is integrable it is a little simpler to use Darboux s formulation as we will see next.   If is continuous on , then so is integrable.    Sketch of Alleged Proof  Note that we re calling this an alleged proof. That means that it contains a flaw somewhere. As you read it see if you can find where it goes wrong.  We already know that   If we can also show that then the conclusion follows immediately.                   Let be given. Since is continuous at each point in , we can choose a such that if , then .  Since is continuous on it is continuous on each subinterval. Next define and to be the respective minimum and maximum of on the subinterval . If we choose a partition such that , then on each subinterval , we have .  Thus    QED?    Did you find the flaw in the proof? If not, read it carefully once more before reading on.           We say alleged proof because there is a subtle problem. Because is continuous on it is continuous at each point . This says that for each , there is a , such that if then . But if you look at our sketch of the alleged proof you see that we need a single which works uniformly for all such . This leads to the following definition.             Uniform Continuity  Uniform Continuity  Definition Uniform Continuity   Suppose . We say that is uniformly continuous on provided that for all , there is a such that for all with .    This is called uniform continuity because a single value of works uniformly for all , whereas in regular continuity, may depend on the value of . It is clear that any function which is uniformly continuous on a set is continuous on , but the converse is not always true. That is, uniform continuity is a stronger property than continuity .   Consider on . Show that for any , whenever . Explain why this says that is not uniformly continuous on .                          Our alleged proof of is in fact a valid proof that a uniformly continuous function is (Darboux) integrable. But as points out, a continuous function need not be uniformly continuous. The hypothesis of requires that the function be defined on a closed bounded interval, so the difficulty in is that the interval while closed, is unbounded. The following lemma closes the gap.       If is continuous on the closed, bounded interval , then is uniformly continuous on .    Sketch of Proof  We will do a proof by contradiction. Suppose is not uniformly continuous on . Then there is an such that for any , there are with , but . If we let , then we can create two sequences with , but By the Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem, there is a and a subsequence with . Given how was constructed, . Since is continuous at , you should be able to get a contradiction out of this.    Turn the above outline into a proof of .    Prove .   The evolution of the modern definition of a function is parallel to, and intertwined with, the definition of the definite integral. Issues of integrability were not prevalent in 18th century because for most of that time the words integral and antiderivative were synonymous. Thus the only integrable functions were the ones that were derivatives of some other function. But in the 19th century, and especially after Fourier, we needed to integrate functions that were not clearly derivatives of something else. As a result the need for a precise definition of function became more and more pressing as the years went by. For example, here is the definition of a function from Euler s  Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum  (1748).    A function of a variable quantity is an analytic expression composed in any way whatsoever of the variable quantity and numbers or constant quantities.    This is the function as input\/output machine metaphor that you ve probably used all of your life so far: A number goes in, gears turn or electronic circuits are activated and a new number is generatied as output from those actions. The advent of Fourier series ushered in a need for a much more general definition. Here is Fourier s definition from his  Théorie analytique de la Chaleur  (1822).    In general, the function represents a succession of values or ordinates each of which is arbitrary. An infinity of values being given of the abscissa , there are an equal number of ordinates . All have actual numerical values, either positive or negative or nul. We do not suppose these ordinates to be subject to a common law; they succeed each other in any manner whatever, and each of them is given as it were a single quantity.    This is closer to our modern approach. In the modern definition for each in the domain, there is a unique assigned to it. It is different from Euler s definition in that no formula, and no metaphorical machine is needed to generate an output. A function can be defined by simply giving a list of ordered pairs: (input, output). No other particular rule is needed.  As you can see, making the idea of an integral rigorous was a delicate matter. Perhaps this is why it took so long to develop.                                 "

  "body": " Uniform Convergence  We have developed precise analytic definitions of the convergence of a sequence and continuity of a function and we have used these to prove the EVT and IVT for a continuous function. We have also carefully defined the derivative and the integral and used those definitions to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus , which was instrumental in developing the three forms of the remainder for Taylor Series . We will now draw our attention back to the question that originally motivated these definitions, Why are Taylor series well behaved, but Fourier series are not necessarily? More precisely, we mentioned that whenever a power series converges then whatever it converged to was continuous. Moreover, if we differentiate or integrate these series term by term then the resulting series will converge to the derivative or integral of the original series. This was not always the case for Fourier series. For example consider the function .  We have seen that the graph of is given by     If we consider the following sequence of functions we see the sequence of continuous functions converges to the non-continuous function for each real number . This didn't happen with Taylor series. The partial sums for a Taylor series were polynomials and hence continuous but what they converged to was continuous as well.   Niels Henrik Abel  Portraits Abel  Abel, Niels Henrik portrait of      The difficulty is quite delicate and it took mathematicians a while to determine the problem. There are two very subtly different ways that a sequence of functions can converge: pointwise or uniformly. This distinction was touched upon by Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829) in 1826 while studying the domain of convergence of a power series. However, the necessary formal definitions were not made explicit until Weierstrass did it in his 1841 paper Zur Theorie der Potenzreihen (On the Theory of Power Series) . This was published in his collected works in 1894.  It will be instructive to take a look at an argument that doesn't quite work before looking at the formal definitions we will need. In 1821 Augustin Cauchy proved that the infinite sum of continuous functions is continuous. Of course, it is obvious (to us) that this is not true because we've seen several counterexamples. But Cauchy, who was a first rate mathematician was so sure of the correctness of his argument that he included it in his textbook on analysis, Cours d'analyse (1821).    Cauchy, Augustin  Cauchy s flawed proof that the limit of continuous functions is continuous    continuity  Cauchy's flawed proof that the limit of continuous functions is continuous    Find the flaw in the following proof that if are all continuous at then is also continuous at .

Pointwise Convergence  Pointwise Convergence  Definition Pointwise Convergence  convergence of a series pointwise   Let be a subset of the real number system and let be a sequence of functions defined on . Let be a function defined on as well. We say that  converges to pointwise on provided that for all the sequence of real numbers converges to the number . In this case we write on .    Symbolically, we have such that .  This is the type of convergence we have been observing to this point. By contrast we have the following new definition.   Uniform Convergence  Uniform Convergence  Definition Uniform Convergence  uniform convergence   Let be a subset of the real number system and let be a sequence of functions defined on . Let be a function defined on as well. We say that  converges to uniformly on provided such that .  In this case we write on .    The difference between these two definitions is subtle. In pointwise convergence, we are given a fixed and an . Then the task is to find an that works for that particular and . In uniform convergence, one is given and must find a single that works for that particular but also simultaneously (uniformly) for all . Clearly uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence as an which works uniformly for all works for each individual also. However the reverse is not true. This will become evident, but first consider the following example.   uniform convergence  converges uniformly on    Let and consider the sequence of functions defined on by . Use the definition to show that on .     .    Uniform convergence is not only dependent on the sequence of functions but also on the set .

Notice that for the Fourier series at the beginning of this chapter, the convergence cannot be uniform on as the function is not continuous. This never happens with a power series, since they converge to continuous functions whenever they converge. Although it is not yet obvious that power series converge uniformly, we will soon see that they do and that uniform convergence is what guarantees that they converge to continuous functions. We will also see that uniform convergence is what allows us to integrate and differentiate a power series term by term.  "

  "body": " Uniform Convergence: Integrals and Derivatives   We saw in the previous section that if is a sequence of continuous functions which converges uniformly to on an interval, then must be continuous on the interval as well. This was not necessarily true if the convergence was only pointwise, as we saw a sequence of continuous functions defined on converging pointwise to a Fourier series that was not continuous on the real line. Uniform convergence guarantees some other nice properties as well.   uniform convergence integration and   Suppose and are integrable and on . Then .     uniform convergence integration and   Prove .    For we need to make for all .    Notice that this theorem is not true if the convergence is only pointwise, as illustrated by the following.   convergence pointwise convergence  convergence uniform convergence  convergence pointwise vs. uniform convergence   Consider the sequence of functions given by .   Show that on but     Can the convergence be uniform? Explain.       Applying this result to power series we have the following.   Notice that we must explicitly assume uniform convergence. This is because we have not yet proved that power series actually do converge uniformly.     If converges uniformly to on an interval containing and then .     power series term by term integral of   Prove .    Remember that     Surprisingly, the issue of term-by-term differentiation depends not on the uniform convergence of but on the uniform convergence of . More precisely, we have the following result.   pointwise convergence derivative and  differentiation of the pointwise limit of functions   Suppose for every  is differentiable, is continuous, and on an interval, . Then is differentiable and on .     sequences differentiation of a sequence of functions  differentiation differentiation of a sequence of functions   Prove .    Let be an arbitrary fixed point in and let . By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have . Take the limit of both sides and differentiate with respect to .    As before, applying this to power series gives the following result.    If converges pointwise to on an interval containing and and converges uniformly on an interval containing and then .     power series term by term derivative of  differentiation term by term differentiation of power series   Prove .    Taken together the above results say that a power series can be differentiated and integrated term by term as long as the convergence is uniform. Fortunately it is in general true that when a power series converges the convergence of it and its integrated and differentiated series is also uniform (almost).  However we do not yet have all of the tools necessary to see this. To build these tools requires that we return briefly to our study, begun in , of the convergence of sequences.    Cauchy Sequences  Knowing that a sequence or a series converges and knowing what it converges to are typically two different matters. For example, we know that and both converge. The first converges to which has meaning in other contexts. We don't know what the second one converges to, other than to say it converges to . In fact, that question might not have much meaning without some other context in which arises naturally. Be that as it may, we need to look at the convergence of a series (or a sequence for that matter) without necessarily knowing what it might converge to. We make the following definition.   Cauchy Sequence  Cauchy Sequence  Definition Cauchy Sequence  sequences Cauchy sequences   Let be a sequence of real numbers. We say that is a Cauchy sequence if for any there exists a real number such that if then .    Notice that this definition says that the terms in a Cauchy sequence get arbitrarily close to each other and that there is no reference to getting close to any particular fixed real number. Furthermore, you have already seen lots of examples of Cauchy sequences as illustrated by the following result.   sequences convergence  convergence of a sequence implies Cauchy sequence   Suppose is a sequence of real numbers which converges to . Then is a Cauchy sequence.    Intuitively, this result makes sense. If the terms in a sequence are getting arbitrarily close to then they should be getting arbitrarily close to each other. This is the basis of the proof.   But the converse isn't nearly as clear. In fact, it isn't true in the rational numbers.    sequences convergence  convergence of a sequence implies Cauchy sequence   Prove .     .    So any convergent sequence is automatically Cauchy. For the real number system, the converse is also true and, in fact, is equivalent to any of our completeness axioms: the NIP , the Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem , or the LUB Property . Thus, this could have been taken as our completeness axiom and we could have used it to prove the others. One of the most convenient ways to prove this converse is to use the Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem. To do that, we must first show that a Cauchy sequence must be bounded. This result is reminiscent of the fact that a convergent sequence is bounded ( of ) and the proof is very similar.    Suppose  is a Cauchy sequence. Then there exists such that for all .     sequences Cauchy sequences every Cauchy sequence is bounded   Prove .    This is similar to of . There exists such that if then . Choose a fixed and let .     Cauchy sequences converge  sequences Cauchy sequences convergence of   Suppose is a Cauchy sequence of real numbers. There exists a real number such that .     Sketch of Proof  We know that  is bounded, so by the Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem, it has a convergent subsequence converging to some real number . We have . If we choose and large enough, we should be able to make each term arbitrarily small.    sequences Cauchy sequences convergence of   Provide a formal proof of .    From we see that every Cauchy sequence converges in . Moreover the proof of this fact depends on the Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem which, as we have seen, is equivalent to our completeness axiom, the Nested Interval Property. What this means is that if there is a Cauchy sequence which does not converge then the NIP is not true. A natural question to ask is if every Cauchy sequence converges does the NIP follow? That is, is the convergence of Cauchy sequences also equivalent to our completeness axiom? The following theorem shows that the answer is yes.   sequences Cauchy sequences convergence of is equivalent to the NIP   Suppose every Cauchy sequence converges. Then the Nested Interval Property is true.     sequences Cauchy sequences convergence of is equivalent to the NIP   Prove .    If we start with two sequences and , satisfying all of the conditions of the NIP , you should be able to show that these are both Cauchy sequences.     Problems and tell us that the following are equivalent: the Nested Interval Property, the Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem, the Least Upper Bound Property, and the convergence of Cauchy sequences. Thus any one of these could have been taken as the completeness axiom of the real number system and then used to prove the each of the others as a theorem according to the following dependency graph:     Since we can get from any node on the graph to any other, simply by following the implications (indicated with arrows), any one of these statements is logically equivalent to each of the others.   sequences Cauchy sequences don't always converge in   Since the convergence of Cauchy sequences can be taken as the completeness axiom for the real number system, it does not hold for the rational number system. Give an example of a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers which does not converge to a rational number.    If we apply the above ideas to series we obtain the following important result, which will provide the basis for our investigation of power series.  Cauchy Criterion  series Cauchy sequences Cauchy Criterion   The series converges if and only if  ,  such that if then .     series Cauchy Criterion   Prove the Cauchy criterion.    At this point several of the tests for convergence that you probably learned in Calculus are easily proved. For example:   The th Term Test  series th term test  divergence of a series th term test   Show that if converges then .     The Strong Cauchy Criterion  series Cauchy Criterion Strong Cauchy criterion   Show that converges if and only if .    The hardest part of this problem is recognizing that it is really about the limit of a sequence as in .    You may also recall the Comparison Test from studying series in Calculus: suppose , if converges then converges. This result follows from the fact that the partial sums of form an increasing sequence which is bounded above by . (See of Chapter .) The Cauchy Criterion allows us to extend this to the case where the terms could be negative as well. This can be seen in the following theorem.   series Comparison Test    Comparison Test   Suppose for all . If converges then also converges.     series the Comparison Test  convergence of a series Comparison Test   Prove .    Use the Cauchy criterion with the fact that .    The following definition is of marked importance in the study of series.   Absolute Convergence  Absolute Convergence  Definition Absolute Convergence  convergence of a series absolute   Given a series , the series is called the absolute series of and if converges then we say that  converges absolutely.     The significance of this definition comes from the following result.    If converges absolutely, then converges.     convergence of a series absolute convergence implies convergence   Show that is a direct consequence of .     series absolute convergence of vs. the absolute value of a series   If , then does it follow that ? Justify your answer. What can be said?     series Harmonic Series The converse of is not true as evidenced by the series . As we noted in , this series converges to ln . However, its absolute series is the Harmonic Series which diverges. Any such series which converges, but not absolutely, is said to converge conditionally . Recall also that in , we showed that we could rearrange the terms of the series to make it converge to any number we wished. We noted further that all rearrangements of the series converged to the same value. The difference between the two series is that the latter converges absolutely whereas the former does not. Specifically, we have the following result.   series rearrangements  series absolute convergence of rearrangements   Suppose converges absolutely and let . Then any rearrangement of must converge to .     Sketch of Proof  We will first show that this result is true in the case where . If represents a rearrangement of , then notice that the sequence of partial sums is an increasing sequence which is bounded by . By of , this sequence must converge to some number and . Furthermore is also a rearrangement of . Thus the result holds for this special case. (Why?) For the general case, notice that and that and are both convergent series with nonnegative terms. By the special case  and  .    series  absolute convergence of rearrangements   Fill in the details and provide a formal proof of .     "

As a result of and , we have the following: either converges absolutely for all or there exists some nonnegative real number such that converges absolutely when and diverges when . In the latter case, we call the radius of convergence of the power series . In the former case, we say that the radius of convergence of is . Though we can say that converges absolutely when , we cannot say that the convergence is uniform. However, we can come close. We can show that the convergence is uniform for . To see this we will use the following result   The Weierstrass- Test  Weierstrass- Test   Let be a sequence of functions defined on and suppose that is a sequence of nonnegative real numbers such that .  If converges then converges uniformly on to some function (which we will denote by ).

Identify which of the following series converges pointwise and which converges uniformly on the interval . In every case identify the limit function.                         Using the Weierstrass- test, we can prove the following result.   power series converge uniformly on their interval of convergence   Suppose has radius of convergence (where could be as well). Let be any nonnegative real number with . Then converges uniformly on .     uniform convergence positive power series and   Prove .    We know that converges. This should be all set for the Weierstrass- test.    To finish the story on differentiating and integrating power series, all we need to do is show that the power series, its integrated series, and its differentiated series all have the same radius of convergence. You might not realize it, but we already know that the integrated series has a radius of convergence at least as big as the radius of convergence of the original series. Specifically, suppose has a radius of convergence and let . We know that converges uniformly on an interval containing and , and so by , . In other words, the integrated series converges for any with . This says that the radius of convergence of the integated series must be at least .  To show that the radii of convergence are the same, all we need to show is that the radius of convergence of the differentiated series is at least as big as as well. This would say that the original series has a radius of convergence at least as big as the integrated series, so they must have the same radius of convergence.      Putting the differentiated series into the role of the original series, the original series is now the integrated series and so these would have the same radii of convergence as well. With this in mind, we want to show that if , then converges. The strategy is to mimic what we did in , where we essentially compared our series with a converging geometric series. Only this time we need to start with the differentiated geometric series.   uniform convergence integration and  power series term by term integration of   Show that converges for .    We know that .

Furthermore, the convergence is uniform on any closed interval which tells us that whatever the power series converges to must be a continuous function on . Lastly, if for , then for and for .  Thus power series are very well behaved within their interval of convergence, and our cavalier approach from is justified, EXCEPT for one issue. If you go back to of , you see that we used the geometric series to obtain the series, . We substituted into this to obtain . Unfortunately, our integration was only guaranteed on a closed subinterval of the interval where the convergence was uniform and we substituted in . We danced on the boundary in other places as well, including when we said that .  The fact is that for a power series with radius of convergence , we know what happens when and when . But we've never talked about what happens when . That is because there is no systematic approach to this boundary problem. For example, consider the three series .  They are all related in that we started with the geometric series and integrated twice, thus they all have radius of convergence equal to 1. Their behavior on the boundary, i.e., when , is another story. The first series diverges when , the third series converges when . The second series converges when and diverges when .  Even with the unpredictability of a power series at the endpoints of its interval of convergence, the Weierstrass- test does give us some hope of uniform convergence.   power series Weierstrass- Test and  power series converge uniformly inside their radius of convergence   Suppose the power series has radius of convergence and the series converges absolutely. Then converges uniformly on .    For , .    Unfortunately, this result doesn't apply to the integrals we mentioned as the convergence at the endpoints is not absolute. Nonetheless, the integrations we performed in are still legitimate. This is due to the following theorem by Abel which extends uniform convergence to the endpoints of the interval of convergence even if the convergence at an endpoint is only conditional. Abel did not use the term uniform convergence, as it hadn't been defined yet, but the ideas involved are his.   Abel s Theorem  Abel, Niels Henrik Abel s Theorem   Suppose the power series has radius of convergence and the series converges. Then converges uniformly on .

  "title": "The Rise of Set Theory",
  "body": " The Rise of Set Theory  Cantor s work was instrumental in the re examination of the foundations of mathematics, one where mathematical ideas were recast in the language of sets. Nowadays we do this naturally, so it doesn t seem profound, but recasting mathematics in terms of Set Theory has fundamentally shaped our modern approach. We ve already seen this in , , and where we recast Cantor s definition of a limit point into set theoretic terms.  It turns out that we can also rewrite concepts such as limits and continuity in terms of sets. This led to a subject known as point set topology. We will not present all of the ideas from topology as this would require an entire new course with an entire new book. But we can give you a look into how analysis concepts are recast in this set theoretic manner.  For example, a set of real numbers is called closed if it contains all of its limit points. In other words, is closed if and only if If this sounds the same as our notion of a closed interval , it is meant to since the idea is to recast familiar notions in terms of sets. In fact, this closed interval contains all of its limit points, so it really is closed. To see this, we will show that any point not in is not a limit point of . First, suppose . If , then if we let , then so .   Prove that if , then is not a limit point of . This will complete the proof that is closed.   It is true that the term closed was modeled after closed intervals, but these are not the only closed sets. Each of the following are closed sets.    ,     ,     ,     ,    any finite set,              the union of two closed sets      Convince yourself that each of the above sets is closed.   At this point you can guess that an open set is modeled after an open interval . It is, and this can be defined succinctly as   Open Sets  Definition open set  open set definition of   A set of real numbers is open if its complement is closed.      Show that a set is open if and only if for all there is an such that     Notice that if is closed then is not a limit point of . What does tell you?     Open intervals are not the only open sets. Convince yourself that each of the following are also open sets.         where each is an open set.      Of course, there are sets which are neither open nor closed.  Convince yourself that these sets are neither open nor closed.   ,   ,        Again, we could spend an entire course delving into these concepts and more, but for our introduction we will show how the concept of continuity on a set can be repackaged into a statement involving sets. To transition into talking about functions and sets, we have the following two definitions. So we don't have to get into issues dealing with endpoints on intervals, etc., we will restrict ourselves to talking about functions whose domain is an open set of real numbers.     Definition image  Definition image pre image  image definition  image definition pre image  pre image definition  pre image definition image Let , we define the image of by   For any , we define the preimage of by     With these definitions we have the following result                  Show that is continuous at if and only if for every open set containing there is an open set containing with .        Notice that in the previous problem, can be written as . Based on this observation and the previous problem, continuity of on all of its domain has an even easier condition when stated in terms of open sets.   Show that is continuous on if and only if satisfies the following condition: for any open set of real numbers , is open.   The value of this reformulation of continuity, and similar definitions for limits in terms of open sets is that it can be generalized beyond the realm of real numbers to sets where the distance between points is either irrelevant or not even possible to determine. With this in mind, in 1914, Felix Hausdorff (1868 1942) defined what it means for a general set to have a topology based solely on sets and not relying on formulating a distance between its elements. Given an arbitrary nonempty set , we define a topology on to be a collection of subsets of which we designate to be open sets. The modern rendition of Hausdorff's definition of a topology says that must satisfy the following axioms.    and must be in .    An arbitrary union of open sets in must also be in .    The intersection of any finite number of open sets in must also be in .      Felix Hausdorff   Portrait of Felix Hausdorff    Hausdorff actually added an extra separation axiom.     For any two elements of , there must exist two disjoint open sets and with and .     Nowadays, a topological space (that is a set with a topology defined on it) which has this extra property is called a Hausdorff space.  This relatively simple idea generalizes our notion of open sets of real numbers and can be applied to a wide range of sets. We won't get into this, but we note that if we have a function from one topological space into another, we can define concepts like continuity by insisting that the preimage of any open set in the topology on must be open in the topology on . It would be hard to overstate the impact of this on modern mathematics.  "

This probably does not seem terribly significant. After all, there are real numbers which are not counting numbers. What will make this so startling is that the same cannot be said about all sets which strictly contain the counting numbers. We will get into the details of this after the theorem is proved.   Cantor, (1874)   Cantor, Georg  first proof that is uncountable     is uncountable  Cantor s first proof    Let be a sequence of real numbers. There is a real number , which is not in .   Notation  To streamline things, we are abusing notation here as we are letting denote both the sequence (which is ordered) and the underlying (unordered) set of entries in the sequence.      For the sake of obtaining a contradiction assume that the sequence contains every real number; that is, . As usual we will build a sequence of nested intervals .  Let be the smaller of the first two distinct elements of , let be the larger and take to be the first interval.  Next we assume that has been constructed and build as follows. Observe that there are infinitely many elements of in since . Let and be the first two distinct elements of such that .  Take to be the smaller and to be the larger of and . Then is the th interval.  From the way we constructed them it is clear that .  Therefore by there is a real number, say , such that .  In fact, since it is clear that .  We will show that is the number we seek. That the inequalities in formula are strict will play a crucial role.  To see that we suppose that and derive a contradiction.  So, suppose that for some . Then only appear before in the sequence . Since each is taken from it follows that only finitely many elements of the sequence appear before in the sequence as well.  Let be the last element of which appears before in the sequence and consider . The way it was constructed, was one of the first two distinct terms in the sequence strictly between and , the other being . Since does not appear before in the sequence and , it follows that either or . However, this gives us a contradiction as we know from formula that .  Thus is not an element of .   So how does this theorem show that there are more real numbers than counting numbers? Before we address that question we need to be very careful about the meaning of the word more when we re talking about infinite sets.  First let s consider two finite sets, say and . How do we know that is the bigger set? (It obviously is.) Clearly we can just count the number of elements in both and . Since and and  is clearly bigger. But we re looking for a way to determine the relative size of two sets without counting them because we have no way of counting the number of elements of an infinite set. Indeed, it isn t even clear what the phrase the number of elements might mean when applied to the elements of an infinite set.  When we count the number of elements in a finite set what we re really doing is matching up the elements of the set with a set of consecutive positive integers, starting at . Thus since we see that . Moreover, the order of the match up is unimportant. Thus since it is clear that the elements of and the set can be matched up as well. And it doesn t matter what order either set is in. They both have elements.   cardinality definition Such a match up is called a one to one correspondence. In general, if two sets can be put in one to one correspondence then they are the same size. Of course the word size has lots of connotations that will begin to get in the way when we talk about infinite sets, so instead we will say that the two sets have the same cardinality . Speaking loosely, this just means that they are the same size.  More precisely, if a given set can be put in one to one correspondence with a finite set of consecutive integers beginning at , say , then we say that the cardinality of the set is . But again, the precise statement is that both sets have the same cardinality. It is this notion of one to one correspondence, along with the next two definitions, which will allow us to compare the sizes (cardinalities) of infinite sets.   Definition countable sets  countable sets definition  cardinality countable sets  countable sets defintion of   Any set which can be put into one to one correspondence with is called a countably infinite set. Any set which is either finite or countably infinite is said to be countable .     Cantor, Georg Since is an infinite set, we have no symbol to designate its cardinality so we have to invent one. The symbol used by Cantor and adopted by mathematicians ever since is . Thus the cardinality of any countably infinite set is .   Notation   is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet and is pronounced aleph.  is pronounced aleph null.   We have already given the following definition informally. We include it formally here for later reference.   cardinality definition  Definition cardinality   If two sets can be put into one to one correspondence then they are said to have the same cardinality .     infinite sets uncountable With these two definitions in place we can see that is nothing more nor less than the statement that is not countably infinite since it is certainly not finite and the subscripts identify a one to one correspondence. In that case we say that the set of real numbers is uncountably infinite or just uncountable . Speaking loosely we say that is bigger than the natural numbers.  To see this let us suppose first that each real number appears in the sequence exactly once. In that case the indexing of our sequence is really just a one to one correspondence between the elements of the sequence and    If some real numbers are repeated in our sequence then all of the real numbers are a subset of our sequence and will therefore also be countable by part (a) of .  In either case, every sequence is countable. But says that no sequence in includes all of .

In fact many sets that at first feel like they should be uncountable are not. This makes the uncountability of all the more remarkable.   The failure is in the methods we ve used so far. It is possible to build an uncountable set using just two symbols if we re clever enough, but this would take us too far away from our main topic so we won t pursue it.  Do you see how it might be done?   However if we start with an uncountable set it is relatively easy to build others from it.   sets intervals are uncountable    Let and be two open intervals of real numbers.

Dirichlet invented this function simply as an example of a non integrable function. In itself it has no importance beyond that. However the existence of non integrable functions suggests the question, can the integral be defined in such a way as to capture all of the intuitive features known to 17th century mathematicians and which allows us to integrate something as seemingly bizarre as the Dirichlet Function?    The Steiltjes Integral   Thomas Jan Stieltjes (1856-1894)   Portrait of Thomas Stieltjes    Of particular note is the work of Thomas Jan Stieltjes. While working on the problem of determining the mass distribution of an object given that the moments of all orders of a body are given (called the moment problem) he defined a slight generalization of the Riemann integral which was published in his work Recherches sur les fractions continues (Research on Continued Fractions) in 1894.       As intimidating as the problem sounds, you are acquainted with the idea of a Stieltjes integral, but not by this name. Consider for example, . In trying to compute this integral, you can quickly recognize that this is the integral We are writing the integral this way to emphasize the differential . In the Riemann integral the differential represents the fact that the interval is being partitioned into subintervals whose lengths are being measured. The differential represents the idea that points closer to one carry more weight or are denser than those closer to zero: This says that the lengths of the subintervals in our partition are being measured in different ways. In general, given two functions , the Stieltjes integral is defined by   You can see that the Riemann integral is just the Stieltjes integral with . We won't go further with the Stieltjes integral except to say that it is useful in probability and physics in places where has jumps. With the proper density function, these discontinuities can be minimized. It is also generalizable to functional analysis. It also sets the stage for what we will focus on, which is to find a way to integrate a function such as the Dirichlet function. The trick is to not focus on the function but on the interval on which it is integrated and how to measure the subsets in a partition. This generalization comes from Henri Lebesgue (1875-1941) in 1901.    The Lebesgue Integral   Henri Lebesgue  Portraits Lebesgue  Lebesgue, Henri portrait of   Portrait of Henri Lebesgue    Given Cantor's results that the set of rational numbers is countable while the set of irrational numbers is uncountable, Lebesgue thought that the value of on a relatively ``small'' set such as the rational numbers should have no bearing on the value of an integral and he focused more on measuring the ``sizes'' of sets to take that into account. The basis of this idea comes from the following.   measure zero  zero measure measure zero   Let be countably infinite set of real numbers. Let be given.

Since the rational numbers are countably infinite, then they have measure zero. We won't get into the details of a Lebesgue integral, but it should not be surprising that if two (Lebesgue integrable) functions, and , differ from each other on set of measure zero, then they should have the same value for their Lebesgue integrals. Since the Dirichlet function differs from the constantly one function on a set of measure zero (namely ), then it should be Lebesgue integrable (as a constant function should be) and its integral would be   You may have noticed that we used the term outer measure before. For a measurable set, its measure is this outer measure. However, there are examples of non measurable sets. Any set would have an outer measure, but assigning this as the measure of one of these non measurable sets results in a number of contradictions on how a measure should behave.  The first non measurable set was described by Giuseppe Vitali in 1905. Creating such a set requires the use of something called the Axiom of Choice and delves deeply into a careful study of the theory of sets.

  "title": "Cantor’s Theorem and Its Consequences",
  "body": " Cantor s Theorem and Its Consequences  After employing his ideas on infinite sets of real numbers to study trigonometric series, Cantor gravitated toward applying his ideas to sets in general. For example, once he showed that there were two types of infinity (countable and uncountable), the following question was natural, Do all uncountable sets have the same cardinality?   Just like not all non dogs are cats, there is, offhand, no reason to believe that all uncountable sets should be the same size. However constructing uncountable sets of different sizes is not as easy as it sounds.    Dedekind, Richard    Cantor, Georg  unit interval and unit square have equal cardinalty  For example, what about the line segment represented by the interval and the square represented by the set . Certainly the two dimensional square must be a larger infinite set than the one dimensional line segment. Remarkably, Cantor showed that these two sets were the same cardinality. In his 1877 correspondence of this result to his friend and fellow mathematician, Richard Dedekind , (1831 1915) even Cantor remarked, I see it, but I don t believe it!    Richard Dedekind  Dedekind, Richard portrait of  Portraits Dedekind   Portrait of Richard Dedekind    The following gives the original idea of Cantor s proof. Cantor devised the following function . First, we represent the coordinates of any point by their decimal representations and . Even terminating decimals can be written this way as we could write . We can then define by .  This relatively simple idea has some technical difficulties in it related to the following result.   series Geometric series  converges to   Consider the sequence . Determine that this sequence converges and, in fact, it converges to . This suggests that .    Similarly, we have , etc. To make the decimal representation of a real number in unique, we must make a consistent choice of writing a terminating decimal as one that ends in an infinite string of zeros or an infinite string of nines [with the one exception ]. No matter which choice we make, we could never make this function onto. For example, would have as its pre-image which would be a mix of the two conventions.  Cantor was able to overcome this technicality to demonstrate a one to one correspondence, but instead we will note that in either convention, the function is one to one, so this says that the set is the same cardinality as some (uncountable) subset of . The fact that this has the same cardinality as is something we will come back to. But first we ll try construct an uncountable set which does not have the same cardinality as . To address this issue, Cantor proved the following in 1891.   Cantor s Theorem   Cantor, Georg  Cantor s Theorem    Let be any set. Then there is no one to one correspondence between and , the set of all subsets of .    Since can be put into one to one correspondence with a subset of ( ), then this says that is at least as large as S. In the finite case is strictly greater than as the following problem shows. It also demonstrates why is called the power set of .   sets power set  sets cardinality of a power set  cardinality of a power set   Prove: If , then .    Let . Consider the following correspondence between the elements of and the set of all -tuples of yes (Y) or no (N):   How many elements are in      Cantor, Georg Cantor s Theorem   Remarkably, Cantor s Theorem holds for infinite sets as well.  Prove Cantor s Theorem .    Assume for contradiction, that there is a one to one correspondence . Consider . Since is onto, then there is such that . Is or is     Actually it turns out that and have the same cardinality. This can be seen in a roundabout way using some of the above ideas from . Specifically, let be the set of all sequences of zeros or ones (you can use s or s, if you prefer). Then it is straightforward to see that and have the same cardinality.  If we consider , which has the same cardinality as , then we can see that this has the same cardinality as as well. Specifically, if we think of the numbers in binary, then every real number in can be written as where . We have to account for the fact that binary representations such as and represent the same real number (say that no representations will end in an infinite string of zeros), then we can see that has the same cardinality as , where is the set of all sequences ending in an infinite string of zeros. It turns out that itself is a countable set.     countable sets countable union of finite sets Let . Show that for each , is finite and use this to conclude that is countably infinite.    The above problems say that , , , and all have the same cardinality. The following two problems show that deleting a countable set from an uncountable set does not change its cardinality.     sets countably infinite subsets Let be an infinite set. Prove that contains a countably infinite subset.     countable sets deleting a countable subset   Suppose is an uncountable set and is countably infinite.        Prove that and have the same cardinality.    Let . Since is an infinite set, then by the previous problem it contains a countably infinite set . Likewise since is infinite it also contains a countably infinite set . Again, since is a countably infinite set then it contains a countably infinite set , etc. For , let be a one to one correspondence and define by .  Show that is one to one and onto.     Cantor, Georg As we indicated before, Cantor s work on infinite sets had a profound impact on mathematics in the beginning of the twentieth century. For example, in examining the proof of Cantor s Theorem, the eminent logician Bertrand Russell (1872 1970) devised his famous paradox in 1901.   Bertrand Russell  Portraits Russell  Russell, Bertrand portrait of   Portrait of Bertrand Russell    Through the work of Cantor and others, sets were becoming a central object of study in mathematics as many mathematical concepts were being reformulated in terms of sets, as we saw in . The idea was that set theory was to be a unifying theme of mathematics but Russell s paradox set the mathematical world on its ear because it showed that the naive understanding of a set as just a collection of objects leads to logical difficulties.   Russell s Paradox  Consider the set of all sets which are not elements of themselves. We call this set and ask, Is Symbolically, this set is .  If , then by definition, . If , then by definition, .   If you look back at the proof of Cantor s Theorem, this was basically the idea that gave us the contradiction. To have such a contradiction occurring at the most basic level of mathematics was scandalous. It forced a number of mathematicians and logicians to carefully devise the axioms by which sets could be constructed. To be honest, most mathematicians still approach set theory from a naive point of view as the sets we typically deal with fall under the category of what we would call normal sets. In fact, such an approach is officially called Naive Set Theory (as opposed to Axiomatic Set Theory ). However, attempts to put set theory and logic on solid footing led to the modern study of symbolic logic and ultimately the design of computer (machine) logic.   Cantor, Georg Another place where Cantor s work had a profound influence in modern logic comes from something we alluded to before. We showed before that the unit square had the same cardinality as an uncountable subset of . In fact, Cantor showed that the unit square had the same cardinality as itself and was moved to advance the following in 1878.   The Continuum Hypothesis  Continuum Hypothesis original   Every uncountable subset of has the same cardinality as .    Cantor was unable to prove or disprove this conjecture (along with every other mathematician). In fact, proving or disproving the Continuum Hypothesis, was one of David Hilbert s famous 23 problems which he presented as a challenge for the mathematics community at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900.   David Hilbert  Portraits Hilbert  Hilbert, David portrait of   Portrait of Hilbert    Since has the same cardinality as , then the Continuum Hypothesis was generalized to the:   The Generalized Continuum Hypothesis  Continuum Hypothesis generalized   Given an infinite set , there is no infinite set which has a cardinality strictly between that of and its power set .    Efforts to prove or disprove this were in vain and with good reason. In 1940, the logician Kurt Gödel showed that the Continuum Hypothesis could not be disproved from the Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms of set theory. In 1963, Paul Cohen (1934 2007) showed that the Continuum Hypothesis could not be proved using the Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms. In other words, the Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms do not contain enough information to decide the truth of the hypothesis.   The Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms  One of the formal axiomatic approaches to set theory established by Ernst Zermelo in 1908 and revised by Abraham Fraenkel in 1921.      Kurt Gödel  Portraits Gödel  Gödel, Kurt portrait of   Portrait of Kurt Gödel     Paul Cohen  Portraits Cohen  Cohen, Paul portrait of   Portrait of Paul Cohen      We are willing to bet that at this point your head might be swimming a bit with uncertainty. If so, then know that these are the same feelings that the mathematical community experienced in the mid twentieth century. In the past, mathematics was seen as a model of logical certainty. It is disconcerting to find that there are statements that are undecidable. In fact, Gödel proved in 1931 that a consistent finite axiom system that contained the axioms of arithmetic would always contain undecidable statements which could neither be proved true nor false with those axioms. Mathematical knowledge would always be incomplete.  So by trying to put the foundations of Calculus on solid ground, we have come to a point where we can never obtain mathematical certainty. Does this mean that we should throw up our hands and concede defeat? Should we be paralyzed with fear of trying anything? Certainly not! As we mentioned before, most mathematicians do well by taking a pragmatic approach: using their mathematics to solve problems that they encounter. In fact, it is typically the problems that motivate the mathematics. It is true that mathematicians take chances that don t always pan out, but they still take these chances, often with success. Even when the successes lead to more questions, as they typically do, tackling those questions usually leads to a deeper understanding. At the very least, our incomplete understanding means we will always have more questions to answer, more problems to solve.                What else could a mathematician ask for?  "

  "body": " Epilog #1: On the Nature of Numbers: A Dialogue (with Apologies to Galileo)   Interlocuters : Salviati, Sagredo, and Simplicio; Three Friends of Galileo Galilei    Setting : Three friends meet in a garden for lunch in Renaissance Italy. Prior to their meal they discuss the book A Contextual Introduction to Real Analysis: How We Got From There To Here . How they obtained a copy is not clear.   Salviati : My good sirs. I have read this very strange volume as I hope you have?   Sagredo : I have and I also found it very strange.   Simplicio : Very strange indeed; at once silly and mystifying.   Salviati : Silly? How so?   Simplicio : These authors begin their tome with the question, What is a number? This is an unusually silly question, don t you think? Numbers are numbers. Everyone knows what they are.   Sagredo : I thought so as well until I reached the last chapter. But now I am not so certain. What about this quantity If this counts the positive integers, isn t it a number? If not, then how can it count anything? If so, then what number is it? These questions plague me til I scarcely believe I know anything anymore.   Simplicio : Of course is not a number! It is simply a new name for the infinite, and infinity is not a number.   Sagredo : But isn t the cardinality of the set of natural numbers, , in just the same way that the cardinality of the set is If is a number, then why isn t    Simplicio : Ah, my friend, like our authors you are simply playing with words. You count the elements in the set you see plainly that the number of elements it contains is and then you change your language. Rather than saying that the number of elements in is you say that the cardinality is . But clearly cardinality and number of elements mean the same thing.  Similarly you use the symbol to denote the set of positive integers. With your new word and symbol you make the statement the cardinality (number of elements) of is . This statement has the same grammatical form as the statement the number of elements (cardinality) of is three. Since three is a number you conclude that is also a number.  But this is simply nonsense dressed up to sound sensible. If we unwind our notation and language, your statement is simply, The number of positive integers is infinite. This is obviously nonsense because infinity is not a number.  Even if we take infinity as an undefined term and try to define it by your statement this is still nonsense since you are using the word number to define a new number called infinity. This definition is circular. Thus it is no definition at all. It is nonsense.   Salviati : Your reasoning on this certainly seems sound.   Simplicio : Thank you.   Salviati : However, there are a couple of small points I would like to examine more closely if you will indulge me?   Simplicio : Of course. What troubles you?   Salviati : You ve said that we cannot use the word number to define numbers because this would be circular reasoning. I entirely agree, but I am not sure this is what our authors are doing.  Consider the set . Do you agree that it contains three elements?   Simplicio : Obviously.   Sagredo : Ah! I see your point! That there are three elements does not depend on what those elements are. Any set with three elements has three elements regardless of the nature of the elements. Thus saying that the set contains three elements does not define the word number in a circular manner because it is irrelevant that the number 3 is one of the elements of the set. Thus to say that three is the cardinality of the set has the same meaning as saying that there are three elements in the set . In both cases the number is the name that we give to the totality of the elements of each set.   Salviati : Precisely. In exactly the same way is the symbol we use to denote the totality of the set of positive integers.  Thus is a number in the same sense that is a number, is it not?   Simplicio : I see that we can say in a meaningful way that three is the cardinality of any set with . . . well, . . . with three elements (it becomes very difficult to talk about these things) but this is simply a tautology! It is a way of saying that a set which has three elements has three elements!  This means only that we have counted them and we had to stop at three. In order to do this we must have numbers first. Which, of course, we do. As I said, everyone knows what numbers are.   Sagredo : I must confess, my friend, that I become more confused as we speak. I am no longer certain that I really know what a number is. Since you seem to have retained your certainty can you clear this up for me? Can you tell me what a number is?   Simplicio : Certainly. A number is what we have just been discussing. It is what you have when you stop counting. For example, three is the totality (to use your phrase) of the elements of the sets or because when I count the elements in either set I have to stop at three. Nothing less, nothing more. Thus three is a number.   Salviati : But this definition only confuses me! Surely you will allow that fractions are numbers? What is counted when we end with, say or    Simplicio : This is simplicity itself. is the number we get when we have divided something into equal pieces and we have counted four of these fifths. This is four fifths. You see? Even the language we use naturally bends itself to our purpose.   Salviati : But what of one-fifth? In order to count one fifth we must first divide something into fifths. To do this we must know what one-fifth is, musn t we? We seem to be using the word number to define itself again. Have we not come full circle and gotten nowhere?   Simplicio : I confess this had not occurred to me before. But your objection is easily answered. To count one-fifth we simply divide our something into tenths. Then we count two of them. Since two-tenths is the same as one-fifth the problem is solved. Do you see?   Sagredo : I see your point but it will not suffice at all! It merely replaces the question, What is one-fifth? with, What is one-tenth? Nor will it do to say that one-tenth is merely two-twentieths. This simply shifts the question back another level.  Archimedes said, Give me a place to stand and a lever long enough and I will move the earth. But of course he never moved the earth because he had nowhere to stand. We seem to find ourselves in Archimedes predicament: We have no place to stand.   Simplicio : I confess I don t see a way to answer this right now. However I m sure an answer can be found if we only think hard enough. In the meantime I cannot accept that is a number. It is, as I said before, infinity and infinity is not a number! We may as well believe in fairies and leprechauns if we call infinity a number.   Sagredo : But again we ve come full circle. We cannot say definitively that is or is not a number until we can state with confidence what a number is. And even if we could find solid ground on which to solve the problem of fractions, what of Or Certainly these are numbers but I see no way to count to either of them.   Simplicio : Alas! I am beset by demons! I am bewitched! I no longer believe what I know to be true!   Salviati : Perhaps things are not quite as bad as that. Let us consider further. You said earlier that we all know what numbers are, and I agree. But perhaps your statement needs to be more precisely formulated. Suppose we say instead that we all know what numbers need to be? Or that we know what we want numbers to be?  Even if we cannot say with certainly what numbers are surely we can say what we want and need for them to be. Do you agree?   Sagredo : I do.   Simplicio : And so do I.   Salviati : Then let us invent numbers anew, as if we ve never seen them before, always keeping in mind those properties we need for numbers to have. If we take this as a starting point then the question we need to address is, What do we need numbers to be?    Sagredo : This is obvious! We need to be able to add them and we need to be able to multiply them together, and the result should also be a number.   Simplicio : And subtract and divide too, of course.   Sagredo : I am not so sure we actually need these. Could we not define subtract two from three to be add negative two to three and thus dispense with subtraction and division?   Simplicio : I suppose we can but I see no advantage in doing so. Why not simply have subtraction and division as we ve always known them?   Sagredo : The advantage is parsimony. Two arithmetic operations are easier to keep track of than four. I suggest we go forward with only addition and multiplication for now. If we find we need subtraction or division we can consider them later.   Simplicio : Agreed. And I now see another advantage. Obviously addition and multiplication must not depend on order. That is, if and are numbers then must be equal to and must be equal to . This is not true for subtraction, for does not equal . But if we define subtraction as you suggest then this symmetry is preserved: .   Sagredo : Excellent! Another property we will require of numbers occurs to me now. When adding or multiplying more than two numbers it should not matter where we begin. That is, if , and are numbers it should be true that and .   Simplicio : Yes! We have it! Any objects which combine in these precise ways can be called numbers.   Salviati : Certainly these properties are necessary, but I don t think they are yet sufficient to our purpose. For example, the number is unique in that it is the only number which, when multiplying another number leaves it unchanged.  For example: . Or, in general, if is a number then .   Sagredo : Yes. Indeed. It occurs to me that the number zero plays a similar role for addition: .   Salviati : It does not seem to me that addition and multiplication, as we have defined them, force or into existence so I believe we will have to postulate their existence independently.   Sagredo : Is this everything then? Is this all we require of numbers?   Simplicio : I don t think we are quite done yet. How shall we get division?   Sagredo : In the same way that we defined subtraction to be the addition of a negative number, can we not define division to be multiplication by a reciprocal? For example, divided by can be considered multiplied by , can it not?   Salviati : I think it can. But observe that every number will need to have a corresponding negative so that we can subtract any amount. And again nothing we ve discussed so far forces these negative numbers into existence so we will have to postulate their existence separately.   Simplicio : And in the same way every number will need a reciprocal so that we can divide by any amount.   Sagredo : Every number that is, except zero.   Simplicio : Yes, this is true. Strange is it not, that of them all only this one number needs no reciprocal? Shall we also postulate that zero has no reciprocal?   Salviati : I don t see why we should. Possibly is the reciprocal of zero. Or possibly not. But I see no need to concern ourselves with things we do not need.   Simplicio : Is this everything then? Have we discovered all that we need for numbers to be?   Salviati : I believe there is only one property missing. We have postulated addition and we have postulated multiplication and we have described the numbers zero and one which play similar roles for addition and multiplication respectively. But we have not described how addition and multiplication work together.  That is, we need a rule of distribution: If , and are all numbers then .  With this in place I believe we have everything we need.   Simplicio : Indeed. We can also see from this that cannot be a number since, in the first place, it cannot be added to another number and in the second, even if it could be added to a number the result is surely not also a number.   Salviati : My dear Simplicio, I fear you have missed the point entirely! Our axioms do not declare what a number is, only how it behaves with respect to addition and multiplication with other numbers. Thus it is a mistake to presume that numbers are only those objects that we have always believed them to be. In fact, it now occurs to me that addition and multiplication also needn t be seen as the operations we have always believed them to be.  For example suppose we have three objects, and suppose that we define addition and multiplication by the following tables:   I submit that our set along with these definitions satisfy all of our axioms and thus , and qualify to be called numbers.    Simplicio : This cannot be! There is no zero, no one!   Sagredo : But there is. Do you not see that plays the role of zero if you add it to any number you get that number back. Similarly plays the role of one.   Simplicio : This is astonishing! If and can be numbers then I am less sure than ever that I know what numbers are! Why, if we replace , and with Simplicio  Sagredo, and Salviati then we become numbers ourselves!   Salviati : Perhaps we will have to be content with knowing how numbers behave rather than knowing what they are.  However I confess that I have a certain affection for the numbers I grew up with. Let us call those the real numbers. Any other set of numbers, such as our above we will call a field of numbers, since they seem to provide us with new ground to explore. Or perhaps just a number field ?  As we have been discussing this I have been writing down our axioms. They are these. Numbers are any objects which satisfy all of the following properties:   Definition of Operations   They can be combined by two operations, denoted and + .     Closure   If , and are numbers then is also a number. is also a number.

All seems clear to me now. Numbers are any group of objects which satisfy our axioms. That is, a number is anything that acts like a number.   Salviati : Yes this seems to be true.   Simplicio : But wait! We have not settled the question: Is a number or not?   Salviati : If everything we have just done is valid then could be a number. And so could , if we can find a way to define addition and multiplication on the set in a manner that agrees with our axioms.   Sagredo : An arithmetic of infinities! This is a very strange idea. Can such a thing be made sensible?   Simplicio : Not, I think, before lunch. Shall we retire to our meal?    Any non empty set with operations satisfying Axioms I-VIII is called a field.     Show that the set with operations satisfies all the axioms of a field. What is the multiplicative identity in this field?      Show that in any field for all elements in the field.     .

  "body": " Epilog #2: Building the Real Numbers   Contrary to the title of this section we will not be rigorously building the real numbers here. Instead our goal is to show why such a build is logically necessary, and to give a sense of some of the ways this has been accomplished in the past. This may seem odd given our uniform emphasis on mathematical rigor, especially in the third part of the text, but there are very good reasons for this.  One is simple practicality. The fact is that rigorously building the real numbers and then showing that they have the required properties is extraordinarily detailed work, even for mathematics. If we want to keep this text to a manageable size (we do), we simply don t have the room.  The second reason is that there is, as far as we know, very little for you to gain by it. When we are done we will have the real numbers. The same real numbers you have been using all of your life. They have the same properties, and quirks, they ve always had. To be sure, they will not have lost any of their charm. They will be the same delightful mix of the mundane and the bizarre, and they are still well worth exploring and getting to know better. But nothing we do in the course of building them up logically from simpler ideas will help with that exploration.  A reasonable question then, is, Why bother? If the process is overwhelmingly, tediously detailed (it is) and gives us nothing new for our efforts, why do it at all?   Andrew Wiles  The man who proved Fermat's Last Theorem .    Andrew Wiles has compared doing mathematics to entering a dark room. At first you are lost. The layout of the room and furniture are unknown so you fumble about for a bit and slowly get a sense of your immediate environs, perhaps a vague notion of the organization of the room as a whole. Eventually, after much, often tedious exploration, you become quite comfortable in your room. But always there will be dark corners; hidden areas you have not yet explored. Such a dark area may hide anything; the latches to unopened doors you didn t know were there; a clamp whose presence explains why you couldn t move that little desk in the corner; even the light switch that would allow you to illuminate an area more clearly than you would have imagined possible.   Andrew Wiles  Portraits Wiles  Wiles, Andrew portrait of   Portrait of Andrew Wiles    But, and this is the point, there is no way to know what you will find there until you walk into that dark corner and begin exploring. Perhaps nothing. But perhaps something wonderful.   measure zero This is what happened in the late nineteenth century. The real numbers had been used since the Pythagoreans learned that was irrational. But really, most calculations were (and still are) done with just the rational numbers. Moreover, since forms a set of measure zero, it is clear that most of the real numbers had gone completely unused. The set of real numbers was thus one of those dark corners of mathematics. It had to be explored.   Measure Zero Sets  See of .    But even if that is true, you might ask, I have no interest in the logical foundations of the real numbers, especially if such knowledge won t tell me anything I don t already know. Why do I need to know all of the details of constructing from   The answer to this is very simple: You don t.  That s the other reason we're not covering all of the details of this material. We will explain enough to light up, dimly perhaps, this little corner of mathematics. Later, should you need (or want) to come back to this and explore further you will have a foundation to start with. Nothing more.  Until the nineteenth century the geometry of Euclid, as given in his book The Elements, was universally regarded as the touchstone of mathematical perfection. This belief was so deeply embedded in Western culture that as recently as 1923, Edna St. Vincent Millay opened one of the poems in her book The Harp Weaver and Other Poems with the line Euclid alone has looked on beauty bare.   Euclid begins his book by stating  Common Notions (essentially some elementary rules of logic) and simple geometric Axioms and proceeds, step by logical step, to build up his geometry. Although far from actual perfection, his methods are clean, precise and efficient he arrives at the Pythagorean Theorem in only steps (theorems) and even today Euclid s The Elements still sets a very high standard of mathematical exposition and parsimony.  The goal of starting with what is clear and simple and proceeding logically, rigorously, to what is complex is still a guiding principle of all mathematics for a variety of reasons. In the late nineteenth century, this principle was brought to bear on the real numbers. That is, some properties of the real numbers that at first seem simple and intuitively clear turn out on closer examination, as we have seen, to be rather counter-intuitive. This alone is not really a problem. We can have counter-intuitive properties in our mathematics indeed, this is a big part of what makes mathematics interesting as long as we arrive at them logically, starting from simple assumptions the same way Euclid did.  Having arrived at a view of the real numbers which is comparable to that of our nineteenth century colleagues, it should now be clear that the real numbers and their properties must be built up from simpler concepts as suggested by our Italian friends in the previous section.  In addition to those properties we have discovered so far, both and share another property which will be useful. We have used it throughout this text but have not heretofore made it explicit. They are both linearly ordered . We will now make this property explicit.   Linear Ordering  number field linearly order  Definition linear order  linear order definition   A number field is said to be linearly ordered if there is a relation, denoted , on the elements of the field which satisfies all of the following for all , and in the field.     For all numbers and in the field, exactly one of the following holds:                       If , then for all in the field.    If , and , then .    If and then .       Any number field with such a relation is called a linearly ordered number field and as the following problem shows, not every number field is linearly ordered.   number field linearly ordered    Prove that the following must hold in any linearly ordered number field.      if and only if .    If and then .    For all , .     .         Show that the set of complex numbers ( ) is not a linearly ordered field.     In a thorough, rigorous presentation we would now assume the existence of the natural numbers , and their properties and use these to define the integers, . We would then use the integers to define the rational numbers, . We could then show that the rationals satisfy the field axioms worked out in the previous section, and that they are linearly ordered.  Then at last we would use to define the real numbers , show that these satisfy the field axioms and also have the other properties we expect: The Nested Interval Property , the Least Upper Bound Property , the Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem , the convergence of all Cauchy sequences , and linear ordering .  We would start with the natural numbers because they seem to be simple enough that we can simply assume their properties. As Leopold Kronecker (1823-1891) said: God made the natural numbers, all else is the work of man.   Unfortunately this is rather a lot to fit into this epilog so we will have to abbreviate the process rather severely.  We will assume the existence and properties of the rational numbers. Building from the integers is not especially hard and it is easy to show that they satisfy the axioms worked out by Salviati, Sagredo and Simplicio in the previous section. But the level of detail required for rigor quickly becomes onerous.  Even starting at this fairly advanced position in the chain of logic there is still a considerable level of detail needed to complete the process. Therefore our exposition will necessarily be incomplete.  Rather than display, in full rigor, how the real numbers can be built up from the rationals we will show, in fairly broad terms, three ways this has been done in the past. We will give references later in case you d like to follow up and learn more.    The Decimal Expansion  This is by far the most straightforward method we will examine. Observe that if then expressing as a decimal gives a repeating infinite decimal . For example where zero is repeated and where three is repeated.  Before going further there is a small detail that needs to be addressed. Since we see that there are two ways to represent as a repeating decimal. In fact any decimal that eventually repeats will have two possible decimal representations, one with repeating zeros and the other with repeating nines. For full rigor we need to systematically choose one or the other. It doesn t matter which.  We would like to define to be the set of all decimal expressions which eventually repeat, If it eventually repeats zeros or nines then it is what we ve called a finite decimal.  We then define the real numbers to be the set of all infinite decimals, repeating or not.  It may feel as if all we have to do is define addition and multiplication in the obvious fashion and we are finished. This set with these definitions obviously satisfy all of the field axioms worked out by our Italian friends in the previous section. Moreover it seems clear that all of our equivalent completeness axioms are satisfied.  However, things are not quite as clear cut as they seem.  The primary difficulty in this approach is that the decimal representation of the real numbers is so familiar that everything we need to show seems obvious. But stop and think for a moment. Is it really obvious how to define addition and multiplication of infinite decimals? Consider the addition algorithm we were all taught in grade school. That algorithm requires that we line up two numbers at their decimal points: .  We then begin adding in the rightmost column and proceed to the left. But if our decimals are infinite we can t get started because there is no rightmost column!  A similar problem occurs with multiplication.  So our first problem is to define addition and multiplication in in a manner that re-captures addition and multiplication in .  This is not a trivial task.  One way to proceed is to recognize that the decimal notation we ve used all of our lives is really shorthand for the sum of an infinite series. That is, if where for all then .  Addition is now apparently easy to define: If and then   But there is a problem. Suppose for some , . In that case our sum does not satisfy the condition so it is not even clear that the expression represents a real number. That is, we may not have the closure property of a number field. We will have to define some sort of carrying operation to handle this.   defining infinite decimal addition   Define addition on infinite decimals in a manner that is closed.    Find an appropriate carry operation for our definition.    A similar difficulty arises when we try to define multiplication. Once we have a notion of carrying in place, we could define multiplication as just the multiplication of series. Specifically, we could define .  We could then convert this to a proper decimal using our carrying operation.  Again the devil is in the details to show that such algebraic operations satisfy everything we want them to. Even then, we need to worry about linearly ordering these numbers and our completeness axiom.  Another way of looking at this is to think of an infinite decimal representation as a (Cauchy) sequence of finite decimal approximations. Since we know how to add and multiply finite decimal representations, we can just add and multiply the individual terms in the sequences. Of course, there is no reason to restrict ourselves to only these specific types of Cauchy sequences, as we see in our next approach.    Cauchy Sequences   Cantor, Georg As we ve seen, Georg Cantor began his career studying Fourier series and quickly moved on to more foundational matters in the theory of infinite sets.   Dedekind, Richard But he did not lose his fascination with real analysis when he moved on. Like many mathematicians of his time, he realized the need to build from . He and his friend and mentor Richard Dedekind (who s approach we will see in the next section) both found different ways to build from .  Cantor started with Cauchy sequences in .  That is, we consider the set of all Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. We would like to define each such sequence to be a real number. The goal should be clear. If is a sequence in which converges to then we will call the real number .  This probably seems a bit startling at first. There are a lot of numbers in (countably infinitely many, to be precise) and we are proposing putting all of them into a big bag, tying it up in a ribbon, and calling the whole thing . It seems a very odd thing to propose, but recall from the discussion in the previous section that we left the concept of number undefined. Thus if we can take any set of objects and define addition and multiplication in such a way that the field axioms are satisfied, then those objects are legitimately numbers. To show that they are, in fact, the real numbers  we will also need the completeness property.  A bag full of rational numbers works as well as anything if we can define addition and multiplication appropriately.  Our immediate problem though is not addition or multiplication but uniqueness. If we take one sequence which converges to and define it to be , what will we do with all of the other sequences that converge to   Also, we have to be careful not to refer to any real numbers, like the square root of two for example, as we define the real numbers. This would be a circular and thus useless definition. Obviously though, we can refer to rational numbers  , since these are the tools we ll be using.  The solution is clear. We take all sequences of rational numbers that converge to , throw them into our bag and call that . Our bag is getting pretty full now.  But we need to do this without using because it is a real number. The following two definitions satisfy all of our needs.   sequences equivalent Cauchy sequences  Definition equivalent Cauchy sequences  equivalent Cauchy sequences definition   Let and be Cauchy sequences in . and are said to be equivalent if they satisfy the following property: For every , , there is a rational number such that for all , , .  We will denote equivalence by writing, .     sequences Cauchy sequences equivalent   Show that:                    and       sequences Cauchy sequences real numbers as Cauchy sequences  Definition real numbers defined as Cauchy sequences  Real numbers as Cauchy sequences   Every set of all equivalent Cauchy sequences defines a real number.    A very nice feature of Cantor s method is that it is very clear how addition and multiplication should be defined.   Definition addition and multiplication of Cauchy sequences  addition of Cauchy sequences  multiplication of Cauchy sequences  sequences Cauchy sequences addition and multiplication of   If and then we define the following:   Addition:       Multiplication:          The notation used in can be difficult to read at first, but basically it says that addition and multiplication are done component-wise. However since and consist of all equivalent sequences we have to take every possible choice of and , form the sum (product) ( ) and then show that all such sums (products) are equivalent. Otherwise addition (multiplication) is not well-defined: It would depend on which sequence we choose to represent and .   sequences Cauchy sequences addition of is well defined  addition of Cauchy sequences   Let and be real numbers (that is, let them be sets of equivalent Cauchy sequences in ).

Then .     From it is clear that in forming we can choose any sequence in to represent and any sequence in to represent . (This is because any other choice will yield a sequence equivalent to .)  Thus we choose to represent and any element of , say , to represent . Then .  Since any other sequences taken from and respectively, will yield a sum equivalent to   we conclude that .    as Cauchy sequences identify the multiplicative identity  the number as a Cauchy sequence   Identify the set of equivalent Cauchy sequences, , such that .     defined by Cauchy sequences  number field for Cauchy sequences  sequences Cauchy sequences field axioms for   Let , and be real numbers (equivalent sets of Cauchy sequences). Show that with addition and multiplication defined as above we have:                                        We will not address this issue here, but you should give some thought to how this might be accomplished.   Once the existence of additive and multiplicative inverses is established the collection of all sets of equivalent Cauchy sequences, with addition and multiplication defined as above satisfy all of the field axioms. It is clear that they form a number field and thus deserve to be called numbers.  However this does not necessarily show that they form . We also need to show that they are complete in the sense of . It is perhaps not too surprising that when we build the real numbers using equivalent Cauchy sequences the most natural completeness property we can show is that if a sequence of real numbers is Cauchy then it converges.  However we are not in a position to show that Cauchy sequences in converge. To do this we would first need to show that these sets of equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences (real numbers) are linearly ordered.  Unfortunately showing the linear ordering, while not especially hard, is time consuming. So we will again invoke the prerogatives of the teacher and brush all of the difficulties aside with the assertion that it is straightforward to show that the real numbers as we have constructed them in this section are linearly ordered and are complete. If you would like to see this construction in full rigor we recommend the book, The Number System by H. A. Thurston .   Thurston first builds as we ve indicated in this section. Then as a final remark he shows that the real numbers must be exactly the infinite decimals we saw in the previous section.     Dedekind Cuts  An advantage of building the reals via Cauchy sequences in the previous section is that once we ve identified equivalent sequences with real numbers it is very clear how addition and multiplication should be defined.  On the other hand, before we can even start to understand that construction, we need a fairly strong sense of what it means for a sequence to converge and enough experience with sequences to be comfortable with the notion of a Cauchy sequence. Thus a good deal of high level mathematics must be mastered before we can even begin.   Dedekind, Richard Dedekind cuts The method of Dedekind cuts first developed by Richard Dedekind (though he just called them cuts ) in his 1872 book, Continuity and the Irrational Numbers shares the advantage of the Cauchy sequence method in that, once the candidates for the real numbers have been identified, it is very clear how addition and multiplication should be defined. It is also straightforward to show that most of the field axioms are satisfied.    Clear does not mean easy to do as we will see.    Dedekind, Richard In addition, Dedekind s method also has the advantage that very little mathematical knowledge is required to get started. This is intentional. In the preface to the first edition of his book, Dedekind states:   This memoir can be understood by anyone possessing what is usually called common sense; no technical philosophic, or mathematical, knowledge is in the least degree required. (quoted in )   While he may have overstated his case a bit, it is clear that his intention was to argue from very simple first principles just as Euclid did.  His starting point was the observation we made in : The rational number line is full of holes. More precisely we can cut the rational line in two distinct ways:   We can pick a rational number, . This choice divides all other rational numbers into two classes: Those greater than and those less than .    We can pick one of the holes in the rational number line. In this case all of the rationals fall into two classes: Those greater than the hole and those less.     But to speak of rational numbers as less than or greater than something that is not there is utter nonsense. We ll need a better (that is, a rigorous) definition.  As before we will develop an overall sense of this construction rather than a fully detailed presentation, as the latter would be far too long to include.  Our presentation will closely follow that of Edmund Landau s in his classic 1951 text Foundations of Analysis  . We do this so that if you choose to pursue this construction in more detail you will be able to follow Landau s presentation more easily.   The Dedekind Cut  Dedekind, Richard Dedekind cuts  Definition Dedekind cut  Dedekind cut   A set of positive rational numbers is called a cut if   Take special notice that we are not using the negative rational numbers or zero to build our cuts. The reason for this will become clear shortly.      Property I  It contains a positive rational number but does not contain all positive rational numbers.    Property II  Every positive rational number in the set is less than every positive rational number not in the set.    Property III  There is no element of the set which is greater than every other element of the set.        Dedekind, Richard Because of their intended audiences, Dedekind and Landau shied away from using too much notation. However, we will include the following for those who are more comfortable with the symbolism as it may help provide more perspective. Specifically the properties defining a Dedekind cut can be written as follows.     Property I   and .    Property II  If and , then . (Alternatively, if and , then .)    Property III  If , then such that .     Properties I-III really say that Dedekind cuts are bounded open intervals of rational numbers starting at . For example, is a Dedekind cut (which will eventually be the real number ). Likewise, is a Dedekind cut (which will eventually be the real number ). Notice that care must be taken not to actually refer to irrational numbers in the properties as the purpose is to construct them from rational numbers, but it might help to ground you to anticipate what will happen.  Take particular notice of the following three facts:   Very little mathematical knowledge is required to understand this definition. We need to know what a set is, we need to know what a rational number is, and we need to know that given two positive rational numbers either they are equal or one is greater.    The language Landau uses is very precise. This is necessary in order to avoid such nonsense as trying to compare something with nothing like we did a couple of paragraphs up.    We are only using the positive rational numbers for our construction. The reason for this will become clear shortly. As a practical matter for now, this means that the cuts we have just defined will (eventually) correspond to the positive real numbers.      Dedekind cut ordering of  Definition ordering of Dedekind cuts  ordering of Dedekind cuts   Let and be cuts. Then we say that is less than , and write if there is a rational number in which is not in .    Note that, in light of what we said prior to (which is taken directly from Landau), we notice the following.   Dedekind, Richard Dedekind cuts ordering of   Let and be cuts. Then if and only if .     Dedekind, Richard Dedekind cuts order properties  ordering Dedekind cuts   Prove and use this to conclude that if and are cuts then exactly one of the following is true:    .     .     .       We will need first to define addition and multiplication for our cuts and eventually these will need to be extended to (once the non-positive reals have also been constructed). It will be necessary to show that the extended definitions satisfy the field axioms. As you can see there is a lot to do.   Dedekind, Richard As we did with Cauchy sequences and with infinite decimals, we will stop well short of the full construction. If you are interested in exploring the details of Dedekind s construction, Landau s book is very thorough and was written with the explicit intention that it would be accessible to students. In his Preface for the Teacher he says   I hope that I have written this book, after a preparation stretching over decades, in such a way that a normal student can read it in two days.   This may be stretching things. Give yourself at least a week and make sure you have nothing else to do that week.  Addition and multiplication are defined in the obvious way.   Addition on cuts  Dedekind cut addition of  Definition addition of Dedekind cuts  addition of Dedekind cuts   Let and be cuts. We will denote the set by .     Multiplication on cuts  multiplication of positive Dedekind cuts  Dedekind cut multiplication of positive cuts  Definition multiplication of positive Dedekind cuts   Let and be cuts. We will denote the set by .    If we are to have a hope that these objects will serve as our real numbers we must have closure with respect to addition and multiplication. We will show closure with respect to addition.   Closure with Respect to Addition  Dedekind, Richard Dedekind cuts closure of   If and are cuts then is a cut.     We need to show that the set satisfies all three of the properties of a cut.     Property I  Let be any rational number in and let be a rational number not in . Then by Property II .  Let be any rational number in and let be a rational number not in . Then by Property II .  Thus since represents a generic element of and , it follows that .    Property II  We will show that the contrapositive of Property II is true: If and then .  First, let . Then there are and such that . Therefore , so that .  Therefore and . Therefore .    Property III  Let . We need to find , . Observe that for some and  .  Since is a cut, there is a rational number such that . Take . Then .       Dedekind, Richard Dedekind cuts multiplication of   Show that if and are cuts then is also a cut.    At this point we have built our cuts and we have defined addition and multiplication for cuts. However, as observed earlier the cuts we have will (very soon) correspond only to the positive real numbers. This may appear to be a problem but it really isn t because the non-positive real numbers can be defined in terms of the positives, that is, in terms of our cuts. We quote from Landau :   These cuts will henceforth be called the positive numbers; . . .  We create a new number (to be read zero ), distinct from the positive numbers.  We also create numbers which are distinct from the positive numbers as well as distinct from zero, and which we will call negative numbers, in such a way that to each (I.e. to each positive number) we assign a negative number denoted by ( to be read minus ). In this, and will be considered as the same number (as equal) if and only if and are the same number.  The totality consisting of all positive numbers, of , and of all negative numbers, will be called the real numbers.   Of course it is not nearly enough to simply postulate the existence of the non-negative real numbers.  All we have so far is a set of objects we re calling the real numbers. For some of them (the positive reals -- that is, the cuts) we have defined addition and multiplication. These definitions will eventually turn out to correspond to the addition and multiplication we are familiar with.  However we do not have either operation for our entire set of proposed real numbers. Before we do this we need first to define the absolute value of a real number. This is a concept you are very familiar with and you have probably seen the following definition: Let . Then   Unfortunately we cannot use this definition because we do not yet have a linear ordering on so the statement is meaningless. Indeed, it will be our definition of absolute value that orders the real numbers. We must be careful.  Notice that by definition a negative real number is denoted with the dash ( ) in front. Thus if is any real number then one of the following is true:    where is a cut as defined in ( is positive)     where is a cut as defined in ( is negative)     .     We define absolute value as follows:   Definition absolute value of a Dedekind cut  absolute value of a Dedekind cut   Let as above. Then     With this definition in place it is possible to show that is linearly ordered. We will not do this explicitly. Instead we will simply assume that the symbols  , and have been defined and have all of the properties we have learned to expect from them.  We now extend our definitions of addition and multiplication from the positive real numbers (cuts) to all of them. Curiously, multiplication is the simpler of the two.   Multiplication  Definition multiplication of Dedekind cuts  multiplication of Dedekind cuts   Let . Then     Notice that the case where and are both positive was already handled by because in that case they are both cuts.  Next we define addition.   Addition  addition of Dedekind cuts  Definition addition of Dedekind cuts   Let . Then .     Notice also that the fifth case refers to the addition as defined in the second case.   But wait! In the second and fourth cases of our definition we ve actually defined addition in terms of subtraction. But we haven t defined subtraction yet! Oops!  This is handled with the definition below, but it illuminates very clearly the care that must be taken in these constructions. The real numbers are so familiar to us that it is extraordinarily easy to make unjustified assumptions.  Since the subtractions in the second and fourth cases above are done with positive numbers we only need to give meaning to the subtraction of cuts.   subtraction of Dedekind cuts  Definition subtraction of Dedekind cuts   If , and are cuts then the expression is defined to mean .    Of course, there is the detail of showing that there is such a cut . (We warned you of the tediousness of all this.) Landau goes through the details of showing that such a cut exists. We will present an alternative by defining the cut directly (assuming ). To motivate this definition, consider something we are familiar with: . In terms of cuts, we want to say that the open interval from to  minus the open interval from to should give us the open interval from to . Taking elements from and subtracting elements from won t do it as we would have differences such as which is not in the cut . A moment s thought tells us that what we need to do is take all the elements from and subtract all the elements from , restricting ourselves only to those which are positive rational numbers. This prompts the following definition.   Dedekind cuts as sets  Definition Dedekind cuts as sets   Let and be cuts with . Define as follows: .    To show that, in fact, , the following technical lemma will be helpful.    Let be a cut, and be positive rational numbers not in with , and let be any rational number. Then there exist positive rational numbers and with , and , such that , and .     Dedekind, Richard Dedekind cuts technical lemma for   Prove .    Since is a cut there exists . Let . We know that . Consider the midpoint . If this is in then relabel it as and relabel as . If it is not in then relabel it as and relabel as , etc.     Dedekind, Richard Dedekind cuts subtraction of   Let and be cuts with . Prove that .    It is pretty straightforward to show that . To show that , we let . Since , we have with . We can assume without loss of generality that . (Why?) Choose with . By the , there exists positive rational numbers and with , , , and . Show that .    We will end by saying that no matter how you construct the real number system, there is really only one. More precisely we have the following theorem which we state without proof.   In fact, not proving this result seems to be standard in real analysis references. Most often it is simply stated as we do here.    any complete, linearly ordered field is isomorphic to  fields any complete, linearly ordered field is isomorphic to .   Any complete, linearly ordered field is isomorphic to .    Two linearly ordered number fields are said to be isomorphic if there is a one-to-one, onto mapping between them (such a mapping is called a bijection) which preserves addition, multiplication, and order. More precisely, if and are both linearly ordered fields, and is the mapping then              .     Remember that we warned you that these constructions were fraught with technical details that are not necessarily illuminating. Nonetheless, at this point, you have everything you need to show that the set of all real numbers as defined above is linearly ordered and satisfies the Least Upper Bound property.  But we will stop here in order, to paraphrase Descartes, to leave for you the joy of further discovery.   "
