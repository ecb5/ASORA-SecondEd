  <title>Back to the Real Numbers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we have seen, when they converge, power series are very well
      behaved.  The fact Fourier (trigonometric) series weren<rsq/>t
      always well behaved was a puzzle and it made them a lightning
      rod for mathematical study in the nineteenth century.
    </p>

    <p> 
      For example, consider the question of uniqueness.  We saw in
      <xref ref="TaylorSeries"></xref> that if a function could
      be represented by a power series, then that series must be the
      Taylor series.  More precisely, if <me> f(x)=\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty
      a_n(x-a)^n </me>, then <me> a_n=\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}  </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <idx><h>Fourier, Jean Baptiste Joseph</h></idx> 

      But what can be said about the uniqueness of a trigonometric
      series?  If we can represent a function <m>f</m> as a general
      trigonometric series <me> f(x)=\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty(a_n\cos n\pi
      x\,+b_n\sin n\pi x) </me>, then must this be the Fourier series
      with the coefficients as determined by Fourier?
    </p>

    <p>
      If 
      <m>
        \displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty(a_n\cos n\pi x + b_n\sin n\pi x)
      </m>
      converges uniformly to <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[0,1]</m>
      then <mdash/> because of the uniform convergence <mdash/>
      Fourier<rsq/>s term<ndash/>by<ndash/>term integration is
      perfectly legitimate. Moreover the coefficients will of
      necessity be the coefficients computed in <xref
      ref="EQUATIONSineCoeffFourier">equation</xref> and <xref
      ref="EQUATIONCosineCoeffFourier" >equation</xref> .  However we
      have seen that the convergence of a Fourier series need not be
      uniform.  This does not mean that we cannot integrate
      term<ndash/>by<ndash/>term, but it does say that we can<rsq/>t
      be sure that term<ndash/>by<ndash/>term integration of a Fourier
      series will yield the integral of the associated function.
    </p>

    <p>
      <idx><h>Lebesgue, Henri</h></idx> 
      <idx><h>Cantor, Georg</h></idx> 

      Such questions led to a generalization of the integral by 
      <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Lebesgue/" >Henri Lebesgue</url>
      in <m>1905</m>.  Lebesgue<rsq/>s profound work settled the question: <q>Is
      a bounded pointwise converging trigonometric series the
      Fourier series of a function?</q> We will (very briefly) describe some of 
      Lebesgue<rsq/>s work in <xref ref="SECTIONLebesgMeas" ></xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before we can do that we will need to understand the
      pioneering work of <url
      href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Cantor/"
      >Georg
      Cantor</url> (1845<ndash/>1918) on <term>Set Theory</term> in the late 19th
      century.
      Cantor<rsq/>s work was also profound and had far reaching
      implications in modern mathematics.  It also leads to some
      seemingly very weird conclusions.
    </p>
    <aside>
      
      <title>
        <lsq/>Weird<rsq/> does not mean false.  
      </title>

      <p>
        It simply means that some of Cantor<rsq/>s results can be
        hard to accept, even after you have seen the proofs and
        verified their validity.

    <p>
      To begin, let<rsq/>s suppress the underlying function and suppose we
      have
      <me>
        \sum_{n=0}^\infty(a_n\cos n\pi x\,+b_n\sin n\pi x) =
        \sum_{n=0}^\infty(a^\prime_n\cos n\pi x\,+b^\prime_n\sin n\pi
        x) </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We ask: If these two series are equal must it be true that
      <m>a_n=a^\prime_n</m> and <m>b_n=b^\prime_n</m>?  We can
      reformulate this uniqueness question as follows: Suppose

      <me>
        \displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left((a_n-a^\prime_n)\cos n\pi
        x +(b_n-b^\prime_n)\sin n\pi x\right) = 0 
        </me>.

        If we let <m>c_n = a_n-a^\prime_n</m> and <m>d_n =
        b_n-b^\prime_n</m>, then the question becomes: If
        <me>\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(c_n\cos n\pi x\,+d_n\sin n\pi
          x\right) = 0</me>, is it necessarily true that
        <m>c_n=d_n=0</m>?  </p>

    <p>
      Intuitively, it certainly seems reasonable to suppose so, but
      at this point we have enough experience with infinite sums to
      know that we need to be very careful about relying on the
      intuition we have gained from finite sums.

      Answering this question led Cantor to study the
      makeup of the real number system.  This in turn opened the door
      to the twentieth century view of mathematics.  In
      particular, Cantor proved the following result in <m>1871</m><nbsp

      In his attempts to nail down precisely which <q>certain

    <p>
      Observe that this is not a trivial generalization.  Although the
      exceptional points are constrained to be finite in number, this
      number could still be extraordinarily large.  That is, even if
      the series given above differed from zero on
      <m>10^{\left(10^{100000}\right)}</m> distinct points in the
      interval <m>\left(0, 10^{-\left(10^{100000}\right)}\right)</m>
      the coefficients still vanish.  This remains true even if at
      each of these <m>10^{\left(10^{100000}\right)}</m> points the
      series converges to <m>10^{\left(10^{100000}\right)}</m>.  This
      is truly remarkable when you think of it this way.

    <p>
      At this point Cantor became more interested in these exceptional
      points than in the Fourier series problem that he<rsq/>d started
      with.  The next task he set for himself was to see just how
      general the set of exceptional points could be.  Following
      Cantor<rsq/>s lead we make the following definitions.

    <title>The Rise of Set Theory</title>

    <p>
      Cantor<rsq/>s work was instrumental in the re<ndash/>examination
      of the foundations of mathematics, whereby mathematical ideas
      were recast in the language of sets. Nowadays we do this
      naturally, so it doesn<rsq/>t seem profound, but recasting
      mathematics in terms of <term>Set Theory</term> has
      fundamentally shaped our modern approach.  We<rsq/>ve already
      seen this in <xref ref="def_accumulation-point"></xref>, <xref
      ref="PROBLEMAccumulationPoint"></xref>, and <xref
      ref="def_derived-set"></xref> where we recast Cantor<rsq/>s
      definition of a limit point into set theoretic terms.
    </p> 

    <p>
      It turns out that we can also rewrite concepts such as limits
      and continuity in terms of sets.  This led to a subject known as
      point set topology.  We will not present all of the ideas from
      topology as this would require an entire new course with an
      entire new book.  But we can give you a brief look at how
      analysis concepts are recast in  set theoretic form.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a set of real numbers <m>S</m> (not necessarily an
      interval) is called closed if it contains all of its limit
      points. Notice how similar this is to the definition of a closed
      interval. Since a closed interval contains all of its limit
      points (the endpoints), it is also a closed set.  To see this,
      we will show that any point not in <m>S=[a,b]</m> is not a limit
      point of <m>S</m>. 
      <!-- First, suppose <m>c\notin [a,b]</m>.  If -->
      <!-- <m>c\lt a</m>, then if we let <m>\eps =a-c\gt0</m>, then -->
      <!-- <me>\left(c-\eps ,c+\eps \right)\cap -->
      <!-- \left[a,b\right]-\left\{c\right\}=\emptyset </me> so <m>c\notin -->

      The value of this reformulation of continuity (and similar
      definitions involving limits) in terms of open sets is that
      the concept of continuity can be generalized beyond the realm
      of real numbers to sets where the distance between points is
      either irrelevant or not even possible to determine. In
      <m>1914</m>, <url
      href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hausdorff/"
      >Felix Hausdorff</url> (1868<ndash/>1942) defined the concept
      of a <term>topology on a set</term>. His definition is based
      solely on sets and does not use the notion of <q>distance</q>
      or <q>length</q>which we have relied on hitherto. (The <m>\eps
      </m> and <m>\delta </m> that appeared in almost all of our
      convergence proofs measure a distance of some sort.)

      Given an arbitrary nonempty set <m>S</m>, we define a topology
      on <m>S</m> to be a collection <m>\tau </m> of subsets of
      <m>S</m> which we designate to be <q>open</q> sets.  The
      modern rendition of Hausdorff<rsq/>s definition of a topology
      says that <m>\tau </m> must satisfy the following axioms.
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>S</m> and <m>\emptyset </m> must be in <m>\tau </m>.

            An arbitrary union of open sets in <m>\tau </m> must also be in <m>\tau </m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            The intersection of any finite number of open sets in <m>\tau </m> must also be in <m>\tau </m>.

        </li>
      </ul>

    </p>



    <p>
      Hausdorff actually added an extra <q>separation axiom</q>.

    <p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            For any two elements <m>x,y</m> of <m>S</m>, there must
            exist two disjoint open sets <m>U_x</m> and <m>U_y</m>
            with <m>x\in U_x</m> and <m>y\in U_y</m>.

      </ul>

    </p>
    <p>
      Nowadays, a topological space (that is a set with a topology
      defined on it) which has this extra property is called a
      <term>Hausdorff space</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This relatively simple idea generalizes our notion of open
      intervals in the real numbers and can be applied to a wide
      range of sets. We won<rsq/>t go into this very deeply, but we
      note that if we have a function <m>f:S\to T</m> from one
      topological space into another, we can define concepts like
      continuity by insisting that the preimage of any open set in
      the topology on <m>T</m> must be open in the topology on
      <m>S</m>.  It would be hard to overstate the impact of 
      generalizaions of this sort on modern mathematics.

    Cantor<rsq/>s work with Fourier series prompted him to study the
    sizes of various infinite sets.  The following theorem follows
    directly from our previous work with the <xref ref="NIP"
    text="custom">NIP</xref> and will be very handy later.  It is a
    slightly weaker version of the NIP which says that the
    intersection of a sequence of nested closed intervals will be

    converge to zero.

    <xref ref="franks10__cantor_other_proof_rr_uncoun" />. This
    probably does not seem terribly significant.  After all, there
    are real numbers which are not counting numbers.  What will make
    this so startling is that the same cannot be said about all sets
    which strictly contain the counting numbers.  We will get into

  <proof>
    <p>
      For the sake of obtaining a contradiction assume that the

      <m>S=\RR</m>.  As usual we will build a sequence of nested
      intervals <m>\left(\left[x_i,
      y_i\right]\right)_{i=1}^\infty</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>x_1</m> be the smaller of the first two distinct
      elements of <m>S</m>, let <m>y_1</m> be the larger and take
      <m>\left[x_1,y_1\right]</m> to be the first interval.
    </p>

    <!-- <p> -->
    <!--   Next we assume that <m>\left[x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right]</m> has -->
    <!--   been constructed and build <m>\left[x_n, y_n\right]</m> as -->
    <!--   follows.  Observe that there are infinitely many elements of -->
    <!--   <m>S</m> in <m>\left(x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right)</m> since -->
    <!--   <m>S=\RR</m>.  Let <m>s_m</m> and <m>s_k</m> be the first two -->
    <!--   distinct elements of <m>S</m> such that <me> s_m, s_k \in -->
    <!--   \left(x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right) </me>. -->
    <!-- </p> -->
    <p>
      Next we assume that <m>\left[x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right]</m> has
      been constructed and build <m>\left[x_n, y_n\right]</m> as
      follows.  Observe that there are infinitely many elements of
      <m>S</m> in <m>\left(x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right)</m> since
      <m>S=\RR</m>.  Let <m>x_n</m> and <m>y_n</m> be the first two
      distinct elements of <m>S</m> such that <me> x_n, y_n \in
      \left(x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right) </me> with <m>x_n\lt y_n</m>.
      Then <m>\left[x_n,
      y_n\right]</m> is the <m>n</m>th interval.
    </p>

    <!-- <p> -->
    <!--   Take <m>x_n</m> to be the smaller and <m>y_n</m> to be the -->
    <!--   larger of <m>s_m</m> and <m>s_k</m>.  Then <m>\left[x_n, -->
    <!--   y_n\right]</m> is the <m>n</m>th interval. -->
    <!-- </p> -->

    <p>
      From the way we constructed them it is clear that <me>
      \left[x_1, y_1\right] \supseteq \left[x_2, y_2\right]
      \supseteq \left[x_3, y_3\right] \supseteq \ldots </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore by <xref ref="thm_WeakNIP"></xref> there is a
      real number, say <m>c</m>, such that <me> c\in\left[x_n,
      y_n\right] \text{ for all } n\in\NN </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, since <m>x_1\lt x_2\lt x_3\ldots\lt y_3\lt y_2\lt
      y_1</m> it is clear that
      <men xml:id="eq_NIP-interval">
        x_n\lt c\lt y_n, \ \forall n
        </men>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will show that <m>c</m> is the number we seek.  That the
      inequalities in <xref ref="eq_NIP-interval">formula</xref> are
      strict will play a crucial role.
    </p>

    <p>
      To see that <m>c\not\in S</m> we suppose that <m>c\in S</m>
      and derive a contradiction.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, suppose that <m>c=s_p</m> for some <m>p\in\NN</m>.  Then
      only <m>\left\{s_1, s_2,\ldots, s_{p-1}\right\}</m> appear
      before <m>s_p</m> in the sequence <m>S</m>.  Since each
      <m>x_n</m> is taken from <m>S</m> it follows that only
      finitely many elements of the sequence <m>(x_n)</m> appear
      before <m>s_p=c</m> in the sequence as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>x_l</m> be the <em>last</em> element of <m>(x_n)</m>
      which appears before <m>c=s_p</m> in the sequence and consider
      <m>x_{l+1}</m>.  The way it was constructed, <m>x_{l+1}</m>
      was one of the first two distinct terms in the sequence
      <m>S</m> strictly between <m>x_l</m> and <m>y_l</m>, the other
      being <m>y_{l+1}</m>.  Since <m>x_{l+1}</m> does not appear
      before <m>c=s_p</m> in the sequence and <m>x_l\lt c\lt
      y_l</m>, it follows that either <m>c=x_{l+1}</m> or
      <m>c=y_{l+1}</m>.  However, this gives us a contradiction as
      we know from <xref ref="eq_NIP-interval">formula</xref> that
      <m>x_{l+1}\lt c\lt y_{l+1}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus <m>c</m> is not an element of <m>S</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <p>
    So how does this theorem show that there are <q>more</q> real
    numbers than counting numbers?  Before we address that question
    we need to be very careful about the meaning of the word <q>more</q>
    when we<rsq/>re talking about infinite sets.
  </p>

  <p>
    First let<rsq/>s consider two finite sets, say
    <md>
      <mrow>        A=\left\{\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\right\}
      \amp{}\amp{}\text{and}\amp{}\amp{}B=\left\{a,b,c,d,e\right\}.</mrow>
    </md>
    How do we know that <m>B</m>
    is the bigger set? One way is to simply count
    the number of elements in both sets. Clearly <m>B</m>
    is  bigger since <m>\abs{A}=4</m> and <m>\abs{B}=5</m>
    and <m>4\lt 5</m>.  But we have no way of counting the number of elements of an
    infinite set.  Indeed, it isn<rsq/>t even clear what the phrase
    <q>the number of elements</q> might <em>mean</em> when applied
    to  an infinite set. So we need to find another way.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we count the number of elements in a finite set  we are 
    matching up the elements of the set with a set
    of consecutive positive integers, starting at <m>1</m>.  Thus
    since
    <md>
      <mrow>1\amp \leftrightarrow\alpha</mrow>
      <mrow>2\amp \leftrightarrow\beta</mrow>
      <mrow>3\amp \leftrightarrow\gamma</mrow>
      <mrow>4\amp \leftrightarrow\delta</mrow>
    </md>
    we see that <m>\abs{A}=4</m>.  Moreover, the order of the
    match<ndash/>up is unimportant.   Since
    <md>
      <mrow>2\amp \leftrightarrow e</mrow>
      <mrow>3\amp \leftrightarrow a</mrow>
      <mrow>5\amp \leftrightarrow b</mrow>
      <mrow>4\amp \leftrightarrow d</mrow>
      <mrow>1\amp \leftrightarrow c</mrow>
    </md>
    it is clear that the elements of <m>B</m> and the set
    <m>\left\{1,2,3,4,5\right\}</m> can be matched up as well.  And
    it doesn<rsq/>t matter what order either set is in.  They both have
    <m>5</m> elements.
  </p>

  <p>
    <idx><h>cardinality</h><h>definition</h></idx>

    Such a match<ndash/>up is called a one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one
    correspondence.  In general, if two sets can be put in
    one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence then they are the same
    <q>size.</q> Of course the word <q>size</q> has lots of
    connotations that will begin to get in the way when we talk
    about infinite sets, so instead we will say that the two sets
    have the same <term>cardinality</term>. Speaking loosely, this just
    means that they are the same size.
  </p>

  <p> 
    More precisely, if a given set <m>S</m> can be put in
    one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence with a finite set of
    consecutive integers beginning at <m>1</m>, say
    <m>\left\{1,2,3,\ldots, N\right\}</m>, then we say that the
    cardinality of the set is <m>N</m>.  But again, the precise statement is  that
    both sets have the same cardinality.  It is this notion of
    one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence, along with the next two
    definitions, which will allow us to compare the sizes
    (cardinalities) of infinite sets.

        Any set which can be put into one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence with
        <m>\NN=\left\{1,2,3,\ldots\right\}</m> is called a
        <term>countably infinite</term> set.  Any set which is

  <p>
    <idx><h>Cantor, Georg</h></idx>

    Since <m>\NN</m> is an infinite set, we have no symbol to
    designate its cardinality so we have to invent one.  The symbol
    used by Cantor and adopted by mathematicians ever since is
    <m>\aleph_0</m>.  Thus the cardinality of any countably infinite
    set is <m>\aleph_0</m>.

    We have already given the following definition informally.  We

    With these two definitions in place we can see that <xref
    ref="thm_NoSeriesContainsAllReals"></xref> is nothing more nor
    less than the statement that <m>\RR{}</m> is not countably
    infinite since it is certainly not finite and the subscripts
    identify a one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence. In that case
    we say that the set of real numbers is <term>uncountably
    infinite</term> or just <term>uncountable</term>. Speaking
    loosely we say that <m>\RR </m> is <q>bigger</q> than the
    natural numbers.

  <aside xml:id="SizeVsCardinality">

    <p>
      It is natural to use the word <q>size</q> in the context of
      infinite sets but <q>size</q> conjures up a mental image that
      really doesn<rsq/>t apply. This is why we use

  <p>
    To see this let us suppose first that each real number appears
    in the sequence <m>(s_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> at least once.  In
    that case the indexing of our sequence is really just a
    one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence between the elements of

  <p>
    Therefore <m>\left(s_n\right)_{n=1}^\infty </m> is countable.

    All of our efforts to build an uncountable set from a countable

  In our side comment, <xref ref="SizeVsCardinality"
    text="title"></xref> we noted that the mental image evoked by the
    word <q>size</q> isn<rsq/>t really appropriate when discussing
    infinite sets because two sets can have the same cardinality even
    though the first completely contains the second, with some left
    over. For example <m>\ZZ </m> contains all of <m>\NN{}</m>, and
    all of the negative integers as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have a similar problem with the concept of length. Two intervals
    can have the same length even as one completely contains the other,
    with some left over. For example, <m>[0,1]</m> contains all of the
    points in <m>(0,1)</m> in addition to <m>0</m> and
    <m>1</m>. Moreover <q>length</q> is only applicable to intervals
    which are a very specific kind of set.  We will need to be able to
    compute the <q>length</q> of more general sets. To avoid
    confusion we need to use a word other than <q>length</q>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Historically,  the word that has been chosen  is <term>measure</term>. If <m>S</m> is a set of real numbers then <m> \mu

            <p>
              <m>\mu{}</m> is translation invariant. More precisely, if

              <me>
                \mu (S)=\mu(S_x). 
              </me>
              (<m>\mu{}</m> is said to be <term>shift invariant</term>,
              meaning that if you shift every element of <m>S</m> by
              some amount <m>x</m> the measure of the set is unchanged.)

  <p>
    The purpose of
    the first and third statements should be clear.  Since we are
    looking to generalize the concept of length the
    <term>measure</term> of an interval should be its length. For
    example,
    <me>
      \mu
      \left( (a,b)\right) = \mu \left( [a,b]\right) =  \mu \left(
      [a,b)\right) =\mu \left( (a,b]\right) =b-a
      </me>, 
      and if <m>\gamma{}\in\RR{}</m>
      <me>
        \mu
        \left( (a,b)\right) = \mu \left( a+\gamma{},b+\gamma{}])\right) = b-a
        </me>, 
  </p>
  <p>
    The second statement is the <xref ref="TriangleIneq"
    text="custom">Triangle Inequalty</xref> dressed up in the language
    of sets and measures.
  </p>
  <p>
    The conditions given in <xref ref="DEFINITIONMeasureFunction"
    ></xref> are modeled on properties of lengths (of intervals) but
    if that<rsq/>s all we are interested in there is no need to make
    this definition. These properties are easily proven if
    <m>\mu{}</m> is length and the only sets we measure are
    intervals. This definition is here because we want measure other
    kinds of sets in <m>\RR{}</m>. For example using this definition
    we can compute <m>\mu (\ZZ )</m>,  <m>\mu (\NN{}) </m> and
    <m>\mu (\QQ) </m>. What would you guess each of these will be?
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice that <xref ref="DEFINITIONMeasureFunction" ></xref> does not
    require that <m>\mu{}</m> be unique. In fact many measure functions
    have been, and can be defined on <m>\RR{}</m>, but for our purposes
    we only need to touch lightly on one of them, the <term>Lebesgue
    measure</term>, first introduced by <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Lebesgue/" >
      Henri
      Lebesgue</url> (1875-1941) in his doctoral dissertation 
      <pubtitle>
        Intégrale, longueur, aire 
        </pubtitle> (Integral, length, area) <m>1902</m>. By <q>touch lightly</q> we mean that we will only
        actually define the so<ndash/>calle <term>outer measure</term> from
        which Lebegue<rsq/>s measure follows. That will be enough for our
        purposes.

  That we called <m>\lambda_o (S)</m>  and <em>outer</em> measure suggests that there is something called an <term>inner measure</term> and indeed there is. It<rsq/>is definition is given in <xref ref="DEFINITIONInnerMeasure" ></xref>.

  A couple of observations regarding this notation will be helpful here.
  <ul  marker="disc">
    <li>
      <p>
        Since <m>[b-a]</m> and <m>\lambda_o</m> both represent numbers
        the first subtraction in <xref ref="EQUATIONInnerMeasure"
        >equation</xref> is just ordinary subtraction.
      </p>
    </li>    
    <li>
      <p>
        The expression <m>[a,b]</m> normally means the interval from
        <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> which means that the points in the
        interval are ordered, but we are abusing our notation a bit by
        thinking of it simply as an unordered set. In that case the
        expression <m>[a,b] - S</m> represents set deletion rather
        than ordinary subtraction. It represents the set of points
        between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> (inclusive) with the points in
        <m>S</m> deleted.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  The names of the inner and outer measures are descriptive. To
  compute <m>\lambda _o</m> we consider a set of numbers generated by
  a collection of sets which contain <m>S</m>. To compute
  <m>\lambda_i</m> we consider a set of numbers generated by a
  collection of sets which are contained within <m>S</m>. When these
  are the same we have the <term>Lebesgue Measure</term>.

    The Lesbegue Integral
  </title>



  <p>
    A primary objective of this text is to convey to you, the student,
    an appreciation for, and an understanding of, the need for
    rigor. That objective remains in force. However, in this section
    we are at the edge of very deep mathematical waters. Until we
    start the next section we will only be wading in the shallows.  We
    will thus relax our relentless emphasis on rigor for now.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the rest of this section we will set rigor to the side and
    instead appeal to your intuition by the use of sketches. We will
    also reason by analogy rather than precisely (e.g., using <m>\eps
    </m>) and <m>\delta{}</m>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, for the remainder of this section we will assume that
    all of the functions we will consider are positive so that we can
    safely engage your strong intuitive understanding of area. We do
    this because our goal here is only to give you a sense of how
    Lesbegue broadened Cauchy<rsq/>s definition of the integral. In
    particular we will not develop Lebesgue<rsq/>s integral in
    detail. Should you desire a deeper understanding than you<rsq/>ll
    get here a second course in Real Analysis is highly recommended.

    <idx><h>Dirichlet Function</h></idx>

    Recall from <xref ref="PROBLEMDiricheletCountrExamp" ></xref>
    that the <term>Dirichlet Function</term>
    <me> 
      D(x)=
      \begin{cases}
      0, \amp \text{ if }  x \text{ is rational}\\
      1, \amp \text{ if }  x \text{ is irrational}
      \end{cases}

    is not Riemann (Cauchy, Darboux) integrable. Dirichlet invented
    his function as an example of a non<ndash/>integrable
    function. For our purposes it has no importance beyond
    that. However the existence of non<ndash/>(Riemann)integrable
    functions suggests the question: Can the integral be defined in
    such a way as to capture all of the intuitive features of
    (Riemann) integration known to <m>18</m>th century mathematicians
    and which also allows us to integrate something as seemingly
    bizarre as the Dirichlet Function?
  </p>
  <p>
    The answer, of course, is yes. Otherwise we wouldn<rsq/>t have
    asked. Lebesgue defined such an integral at he turn of the twentieth century.
  </p>
  <p>
    Speaking <em>very</em> loosely, if we want to compute
    <m>\int_a^bf(x)\dx{x} </m> where <m>f(x)\ge 0</m> using the
    Riemann (Cauchy) integral we partition the <m>x-</m>axis into
    adjacent intervals with width <m>\dx{x}</m> and then construct
    (infinitesimal) rectangles with area 

    <me>
      f(x)\dx{x} 
    </me> 
    from each differential. Summing these areas <mdash/> computing
    <m> \int_a^b f(x)\dx{x} </m> <mdash/> provides the value
    of the definite integral.
  </p> 

  <p>
    <!--   To compute the area of the rectangle -->
    <!-- constructed at <m>x</m> we need its height, <m>f(x)</m>, and its -->
    <!-- width, <m>\dx{x}</m>.   -->
    <!-- </p> -->

    <!-- <p> -->
    <!--   Rather -->
    <!--   than summing the areas of the rectangle one at a time proceeding -->
    <!--   from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>  -->
    <!--   came up with a different approach -->


    Lebesgue<rsq/>s idea was to find all rectangles with a common
    height first, gather them together, and sum those areas. In letter
    to a colleague he described his process as follows:
  </p>
  <blockquote>

    <p>
      <q>I have to pay a certain sum, which I have collected
      in my pocket. I take the bills and coins out of my
      pocket and give them to the creditor in the order I
      find them until I have reached the total sum. This is
      the Riemann integral. But I can proceed
      differently. After I have taken all the money out of
      my pocket I order the bills and coins according to
      identical values and then I pay the several heaps one
      after the other to the creditor. This is my integral.</q>
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    To see how this worked suppose we want to integrate
    <m>f(x)=\abs{\sin x}</m> from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=\pi{}</m> as seen in <xref ref="FIGURELebegInt1" ></xref> below.
  </p>


  <figure  xml:id="FIGURELebegInt1">
    <caption>In Lebesgue<rsq/>s integral we find the area of each
    colored region first. Notice that there are <m>29</m> regions,
    including the two very thin red regions and three regions with
    zero height located at <m>x=0</m>, <m>x=\pi{}</m>, and
    <m>x=2\pi{}</m>.  </caption>
    <image source="images/LebInt2.png" width="100%">

  </figure>

<p>
  In a Riemann integral we start at <m>x=0</m>, compute the first blue
  area, add to that the first green area, and so on, until we reach
  <m>x=2\pi </m> where we add in the last blue area. Notice that area of
  the first blue rectangle is the height of <m>f(x)</m> multiplied by
  the measure of interval on the <m>x-</m>axis which corresponds to
  the interval <m>\left[ \frac17, \frac27 \right]{}</m> on the
  <m>y-</m>axis. We<rsq/>ll designate that area with
  <m>\mu{(1)}</m>. Similarly <m>\mu (2)</m> represents the measure of
  the base of the first green rectangle, and so on for all <m>26</m>
  regions. (Don<rsq/>t forget the thin red regions. We<rsq/>ll get
  back to those in a bit.)
</p>
<p>
  But nothing says we must add the areas in this order. This is just a
  convention. Lebesgue<rsq/>s ideas was to compute the area of all of
  the blue regions together, then all of the green regions, then the
  orange, and so on. By rearranging the sum this way the total are of
  the blue regions is,

  <me>
    f(1/7)\mu (1) +f(1/7)\mu (13) +f(1/7)\mu (14) +f(1/7)\mu
    (28)
    </me>
    or 
<me>
  f(1/7)\underbrace{\left[ \mu (1) +\mu (13) +\mu (14)
  +\mu(28)\right]}_{=\Lambda_b} 
  </me>.

  The expression <m>\left( \mu (1) +\mu (13) +\mu (14)
  +\mu(28)\right)</m> then represents the total measure of the bases
  on the <m>x-</m>axis of the blue regions which we designate
  <m>\Lambda_b</m>. <m>\Lambda_b</m> is the Lebesgue measure of the
  base of all of the blue regions. Similarly the Lebesgue measure of
  the dark green, orange, light green, purple,  yellow, and red regions are
  <m>\Lambda_d</m>, <m>\Lambda_o</m>, <m>\Lambda_l</m>,
  <m>\Lambda_p</m>,  <m>\Lambda_y</m>, and <m>\Lambda_r</m> respectively.
</p>
<p>
  Our integral is thus 
  <md>
    <mrow>  
      \int_{x=0}^{2 \pi}f(x)\dx{x}=f(1/7)\Lambda_b + f(2/7)\Lambda_d \amp{}+
      f(3/7)\Lambda_o
    </mrow>
    <mrow>
      \amp{} + f(4/7)\Lambda_l + f(5/7)\Lambda_p + f(6/7)\Lambda_y 
    </mrow>
  </md>
</p>
<p>
  But wait a minute! What about the two thin red regions and the ones
  at <m>x=0</m>, <m>x=\pi{}</m>, and <m>x=2 \pi{}</m>? Why did we leave them out?
</p>
<p>
  It should be clear that the measure of these regions must be
  zero. Do you see why?  The only places on our graph where <m>f(x) =
  1</m> are at the two maxima, and the base of any rectangle
  constructed there will have measure zero, <m>\Lambda_r = 0</m>. This
  is clear from the sketch. Moreover in light of part (a) of <xref
  ref="PROBLEMOuterMeasure1" ></xref>. A single point on the
  <m>x-</m>axis has measure zero.

  Thus
  the <q>area</q> of those regions will be <m>1\cdot \Lambda_0 =
  1\cdot 0 = 0</m>. Those points in the domain of our function
  contribute nothing to the integral.
</p>
<p>
  The same is true of the rectangles constructed at <m>x=0</m>,
  <m>x=\pi{}</m>, and <m>x=2\pi{}</m>. (Their heights will also be zero but that is irrelevant.)
</p>





<!-- <p> -->
<!--   Given that Cantor had shown that the set of rational numbers is -->
<!--   countable while the set of irrational numbers is uncountable, -->
<!--   Lebesgue thought that the value of <m>f\left(x\right)</m> on a -->
<!--   relatively <q>small</q> set such as the rational numbers should -->
<!--   have no bearing (or at least very little) on the value of an integral so he focused -->
<!--   more on measuring the relative <q>sizes</q> of different sets in the -->
<!--   domain of <m>f</m>. The basis of this idea comes from the following. -->
<!-- </p> -->



<!-- <p> -->
<!--   The collection of intervals <m>(a_n,b_n)</m> with <m>S\subset -->
<!--   \bigcup^{\infty }_{n=1}{\left(a_n,\ b_n\right)}</m> is called -->
<!--   an open cover of <m>S</m>.  Lebesgue defined the (outer) -->
<!--   measure of a set to be the infimum of the sums <m>\sum^{\infty -->
<!--   }_{n=1}{\left(b_n-a_n\right)}</m> over all such open covers. -->
<!--   In symbols, the (outer) measure of a set <m>S</m> -->
<!--   <m>\left(\lambda_o \left(S\right)\right)</m> is given by -->

<!--   <me>\lambda_o(S)=\inf_{S\subset \bigcup^{\infty}_{n=1}{(a_n,\ b_n)}} \left(\sum^{\infty }_{n=1}{\left(b_n-a_n\right)}\right) </me>  -->


<!-- </p> -->

<p>
  In Lebesgue<rsq/>s scheme there is always the possibility that after
  rearranging our rectangles the measure of the base of a region might
  be zero.  <xref ref="FIGURELebegInt1" ></xref> shows two ways that
  can happen but there are many others. In particular, <xref
  ref="THEOREMMeasureZero" ></xref> shows that it is possible for an
  infinite set to have measure zero.  This has repurcussions for the
  integral of Dirichlet<rsq/>s function,

  <me> 
    D(x)=
    \begin{cases}
    0, \amp \text{ if }  x \text{ is rational}\\
    1, \amp \text{ if }  x \text{ is irrational}
    \end{cases}
    </me>, 

    which we will explore next. 
</p>
<p>
  For our later convenience we define the following
  notations. 
  <ul>
    <li>
      Let <m>\cal{I}</m> represent the set of irrational
      numbers in the interval <m>[0,1]</m>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Let <m>\cal{Q}</m> be the set of rational numbers in the same interval. 
    </li>
  </ul>   
</p>

<p>
  Since <m>D(x)</m> takes on only two values, <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>,
  we need only partition the <m>y-</m>axis in two places, <m>y=0</m>
  and <m>y=1</m>. Gathering all of the rectangles together in the same way we did  above  we see that
  <men xml:id="EQUATIONDirichFunc">
    \int_0^1D(x)\dx{x} = 0\cdot{} \Lambda \left( \cal{I}\right){}+ 1\cdot

  <title>Cantor<rsq/>s Theorem and Its Consequences</title>



  <p>
    After employing his ideas on infinite sets of real numbers to
    study trigonometric series, Cantor gravitated toward applying
    his ideas to sets in general.  For example, once he showed
    that there were two types of infinity (countable and
    uncountable), the following question was natural, <q>Do all
    uncountable sets have the same cardinality?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Just like not all <q>non<ndash/>dogs</q> are cats, there is,
    <foreign>a priori</foreign>, no reason to believe that all
    uncountable sets should be the same size.  However constructing
    uncountable sets of different sizes is not as easy as it sounds.

    <idx>
      <h>Cantor, Georg</h>
      <h>unit interval and unit square have equal cardinalty</h>
    </idx>
    
    For example, what about the line segment represented by the
    interval <m>[0,1]</m> and the square represented by the set
    <m>[0,1]\times[0,1]=\left\{(x,y)|0\leq x,y\leq 1\right\}</m>.
    Certainly the two dimensional square must be a larger infinite
    set than the one dimensional line segment.  Remarkably, Cantor
    showed that these two sets were the same cardinality.  In his
    1877 correspondence of this result to his friend and fellow
    mathematician, <url
    href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Dedekind/"
    >Richard
    Dedekind</url>, (1831<ndash/>1915) even Cantor remarked, <q>I see
    it, but I don<rsq/>t believe it!</q>

  <p>
    The following argument illustrates the idea of Cantor<rsq/>s
    proof.  Cantor devised the following function
    <m>f:[0,1]\times[0,1]\rightarrow [0,1]</m>.  First, we represent
    the coordinates of any point <m>(x,y)\in [0,1]\times[0,1]</m> by
    their decimal representations <m>x=0.a_1 a_2 a_3\cdots</m> and
    <m>y=0.b_1 b_2 b_3\cdots</m>.  Even terminating decimals can be
    written this way as we could write <m>0.5=0.5000\cdots</m>.  We
    can then define <m>f(x,y)</m> by <me> f((0.a_1 a_2 a_3\cdots
    ,0.b_1 b_2 b_3\cdots))=0.a_1 b_1 a_2 b_2 a_3 b_3\cdots </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This relatively simple idea has some technical difficulties in
    it related to the following result.
  </p>

  <problem>
    
    <idx><h>series</h><h>Geometric series</h><h>

    <m>(0.\bar{9})</m> converges to <m>1</m></h></idx> 
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the sequence <m>(0.9,0.99,0.999,\cdots)</m>.
        Determine that this sequence converges and, in fact, it
        converges to <m>1</m>.  This suggests that
        <m>0.999\cdots=1</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    Similarly, we have <m>0.04999\cdots=0.05000\cdots</m>, etc.  To
    make the decimal representation of a real number in <m>[0,1]</m>
    unique, we must make a consistent choice of writing a
    terminating decimal as one that ends in an infinite string of
    zeros or an infinite string of nines [with the one exception
    <m>0=0.000\cdots</m> ]. No matter which choice we make, we could
    never make this function onto.  For example,
    <m>109/1100=0.09909090\cdots</m> would have as its pre-image
    <m>(0.0999\cdots,0.9000\cdots)</m> which would be a mix of the
    two conventions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cantor was able to overcome this technicality and demonstrate a
    one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence, but rather than go into
    that we will simply assert that using either convention it is
    possible to show that the function is one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one. As
    a result the set <m>[0,1]\times[0,1]</m> has the same cardinality
    as some <m>[0,1]</m> which is an uncountable subset of <m>\RR</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    That they both have the same cardinality as <m>\RR</m> itself is
    something we will come back to.  But first we<rsq/>ll try
    construct an uncountable set which does not have the same
    cardinality as <m>\RR</m>.  To address this issue, Cantor proved
    the following in <m>1891</m>.
  </p>

    <statement>

  <p>
    Actually it turns out that <m>\RR</m> and <m>P(\NN)</m> have the
    same cardinality.  This can be seen in a roundabout way using some
    of the ideas from <xref ref="prob_PowerSet"></xref>.
    Specifically, let <m>T</m> be the set of all sequences of zeros or
    ones. <!--  Then it -->
    <!-- is straightforward to see that <m>T</m> and <m>P(\NN)</m> have the -->
    <!-- same cardinality. -->
  </p>

  <p>
    The half<ndash/>open interval <m>(0,1]</m> has the same
    cardinality as <m>\RR</m> and we can show that it has the same
    cardinality as <m>T</m> as well by expressing them in binary form.
    Specifically every real number in <m>[0,1]</m> can be written as
    <me>
    \displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^\infty \frac{a_j}{2^j} =0.a_1a_2a_3\cdots
    </me>
    where <m>a_j\in\left\{0,1\right\}</m>.  We have to account for
    the fact that binary representations such as <m>0.0111\cdots</m>
    and <m>0.1000\cdots</m> represent the same real number (say that
    no representations will end in an infinite string of zeros),
    then we can see that <m>[0,1]</m> has the same cardinality as
    <m>T-U</m>, where <m>U</m> is the set of all sequences ending in
    an infinite string of zeros.  It turns out that <m>U</m> itself
    is a countable set.

  <p>
    The above problems say that <m>\RR</m>, <m>T-U</m>, <m>T</m>,
    and <m>P(N)</m> all have the same cardinality.  The following
    two problems show that deleting a countable set from an

    <idx><h>Cantor, Georg</h></idx>

    As we indicated before, Cantor<rsq/>s  work on infinite sets had a profound impact on
    mathematics in the beginning of the twentieth century.  For
    example, in examining the proof of Cantor<rsq/>s Theorem, the
    eminent logician 
    <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Russell/" >Bertrand Russell</url> (1872<ndash/>1970) devised his famous paradox in
    1901.

  <p>
    Through the work of Cantor and others, sets were becoming a
    central object of study in mathematics.  Mathematical
    concepts were being reformulated in terms of sets, as we saw in
    <xref ref="SECTIONRiseSetTheory" ></xref>.  The idea was that set
    theory was to be a unifying theme of mathematics but
    Russell<rsq/>s paradox set the mathematical world on its ear
    because it showed that the naive understanding of a set as <q>just a
    collection of objects</q> leads to logical difficulties.
  </p>

  <fact xml:id="RussellParadox">
    
    <idx><h>Russell<rsq/>s Paradox</h></idx>

    <p>
      Consider the set of all sets
      which are not elements of themselves.  We call this set <m>D</m>
      and ask, <q>Is <m>D\in D?</m></q> Symbolically, this set is <me>
      D=\{S\ |\ S\not \in S\} </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If <m>D\in D</m>, then by definition, <m>D\not\in D</m>.  If
      <m>D\not\in D</m>, then by definition, <m>D\in D</m>.
    </p>
  </fact>

  <p>
    The idea behind <xref ref="RussellParadox" text="custom">Russell<rsq/>s
    Paradox</xref> is essentially the same idea that gave us a
    contradiction in our proof of <xref ref="thm_CantorsTheorem"
    text="custom" >Cantor<rsq/>s Theorem</xref>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To have such a
    contradiction occurring at the most basic level of mathematics was
    scandalous.  It forced a number of mathematicians and logicians to
    carefully devise the axioms by which sets could be constructed.
    To be honest, most mathematicians still approach set theory from a
    naive point of view as the sets we typically deal with fall under
    the category of what we would call <q>normal sets.</q> In fact,
    such an approach is officially called <term>Naive Set Theory</term> (as opposed
    to <url
    href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Beginnings_of_set_theory/"
    >Axiomatic Set Theory</url>).  However, attempts to put set theory
    and logic on solid footing led to the modern study of symbolic
    logic and ultimately the design of computer (machine) logic.
  </p>

  <p>
    <idx><h>Cantor, Georg</h></idx>

    Another place where Cantor<rsq/>s work had a profound influence in
    modern logic comes from something we alluded to before.  We showed
    before that the unit square <m>[0,1]\times [0,1]</m> had the same
    cardinality as an uncountable subset of <m>\RR</m>.  In fact,
    Cantor showed that the unit square had the same cardinality as
    <m>\RR</m> itself and was moved to advance the following in <m>1878</m>.

  <p>
    Cantor was unable to prove or disprove the <xref

    at the time). In fact, proving or disproving the Continuum

    Since <m>\RR</m> has the same cardinality as <m>P(\NN)</m>, the

  </conjecture>

  <p>
    Efforts to prove or disprove <xref ref="GenContHyp" ></xref> were
    in vain and with good reason.  In <m>1940</m>, the logician <url

    <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Cohen/" >Paul Cohen</url> (1934<ndash/>2007)
    showed that the Continuum Hypothesis could not be proved using
    the Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms, either.  In other words, the
    Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms do not contain enough information to
    decide the truth of the hypothesis.

  <p>
    We are willing to bet that at this point your head might be
    swimming a bit.  If so, then know that these are the same feelings
    that the mathematical community experienced in the
    mid<ndash/>twentieth century.  In the past, mathematics was seen
    as a model of logical certainty.  It is disconcerting to find that
    there are statements that are <term>undecidable</term>. In fact, Gödel
    proved in <m>1931</m> that a consistent finite axiom system that
    contained the axioms of arithmetic would always contain
    undecidable statements which could neither be proved true nor
    false with those axioms.  Mathematical knowledge would always be
    incomplete.
  </p>



  <p>
    So by trying to put the foundations of Calculus on solid ground,
    we have come to a point where we can never obtain mathematical
    certainty.  Does this mean that we should throw up our hands and
    concede defeat?  Should we be paralyzed with fear of trying
    anything?  Certainly not!  As we mentioned before, most
    mathematicians do well by taking a pragmatic approach. We use the
    mathematics we know and understand to solve the problems we
    encounter as best we can.  In fact, it is typically the problems
    that motivate the mathematics.  It is true that we take chances
    that don<rsq/>t always pan out, but still we take those chances,
    often with success.  Even when the successes lead to more
    questions, as they typically do, tackling those questions usually
    leads to a deeper understanding.  At the very least, our
    incomplete understanding means we will always have more questions
    to answer, more problems to solve.
