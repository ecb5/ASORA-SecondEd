  <title>Back to the Real Numbers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we have seen, when they converge, power series are very well
      behaved.  The fact Fourier (trigonometric) series weren<rsq/>t
      always well behaved was a puzzle and it made them a lightning
      rod for mathematical study in the nineteenth century.
    </p>

    <p> 
      For example, consider the question of uniqueness.  We saw in
      <xref ref="TaylorSeries"></xref> that if a function could
      be represented by a power series, then that series must be the
      Taylor series.  More precisely, if <me> f(x)=\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty
      a_n(x-a)^n </me>, then <me> a_n=\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}  </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <idx><h>Fourier, Jean Baptiste Joseph</h></idx> 

      But what can be said about the uniqueness of a trigonometric
      series?  If we can represent a function <m>f</m> as a general
      trigonometric series <me> f(x)=\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty(a_n\cos n\pi
      x+b_n\sin n\pi x) </me>, then must this be the Fourier series
      with the coefficients as determined by Fourier?
    </p>

    <p>
      If 
      <m>
        \displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty(a_n\cos n\pi x + b_n\sin n\pi x)
      </m>
      converges uniformly to <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[0,1]</m>
      then <mdash/> because of the uniform convergence <mdash/>
      Fourier<rsq/>s term<ndash/>by<ndash/>term integration is
      perfectly legitimate. Moreover the coefficients will of
      necessity be the coefficients computed in <xref
      ref="EQUATIONSineCoeffFourier">equation</xref> and <xref
      ref="EQUATIONCosineCoeffFourier" >equation</xref> .  However we
      have seen that the convergence of a Fourier series need not be
      uniform.  This does not mean that we cannot integrate
      term<ndash/>by<ndash/>term, but it does say that we can<rsq/>t
      be sure that term<ndash/>by<ndash/>term integration of a Fourier
      series will yield the integral of the associated function.
    </p>

    <p>
      <idx><h>Lebesgue, Henri</h></idx> 
      <idx><h>Cantor, Georg</h></idx> 

      Such questions led to a generalization of the integral by 
      <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Lebesgue/" >Henri Lebesgue</url>
      in <m>1905</m>.  Lebesgue<rsq/>s profound work settled the question: <q>Is
      a bounded pointwise converging trigonometric series the
      Fourier series of a function?</q> We will (very briefly) describe some of 
      Lebesgue<rsq/>s work in <xref ref="SECTIONLebesgMeas" ></xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before we can do that we will need to understand the
      pioneering work of <url
      href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Cantor/"
      >Georg
      Cantor</url> (1845<ndash/>1918) on <term>Set Theory</term> in the late 19th
      century.
      Cantor<rsq/>s work was also profound and had far reaching
      implications in modern mathematics.  It also leads to some
      seemingly very weird conclusions.
    </p>
    <aside>
      
      <title>
        <lsq/>Weird<rsq/> does not mean false.  
      </title>

      <p>
        It simply means that some of Cantor<rsq/>s results can be
        hard to accept, even after you have seen the proofs and
        verified their validity.

    <p>
      To begin, let<rsq/>s suppress the underlying function and suppose we
      have
      <me>
        \sum_{n=0}^\infty(a_n\cos n\pi x+b_n\sin n\pi x) =
        \sum_{n=0}^\infty(a^\prime_n\cos n\pi x+b^\prime_n\sin n\pi
        x) </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We ask: If these two series are equal must it be true that
      <m>a_n=a^\prime_n</m> and <m>b_n=b^\prime_n</m>?  We can
      reformulate this uniqueness question as follows: Suppose

      <me>
        \displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left((a_n-a^\prime_n)\cos n\pi
        x +(b_n-b^\prime_n)\sin n\pi x\right) = 0 
        </me>.

        If we let <m>c_n = a_n-a^\prime_n</m> and <m>d_n =
        b_n-b^\prime_n</m>, then the question becomes: If
        <me>\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(c_n\cos n\pi x+d_n\sin n\pi
        x\right) = 0</me>, is it necessarily true that
        <m>c_n=d_n=0</m>?  </p>

    <p>
      Intuitively, it certainly seems reasonable to suppose so, but
      at this point we have enough experience with infinite sums to
      know that we need to be very careful about relying on the
      intuition we have gained from finite sums.

      Answering this question led Cantor to study the
      makeup of the real number system.  This in turn opened the door
      to the twentieth century view of mathematics.  In
      particular, Cantor proved the following result in <m>1871</m><nbsp

      In his attempts to nail down precisely which <q>certain

    <p>
      Observe that this is not a trivial generalization.  Although the
      exceptional points are constrained to be finite in number, this
      number could still be extraordinarily large.  That is, even if
      the series given above differed from zero on
      <m>10^{\left(10^{100000}\right)}</m> distinct points in the
      interval <m>\left(0, 10^{-\left(10^{100000}\right)}\right)</m>
      the coefficients still vanish.  This remains true even if at
      each of these <m>10^{\left(10^{100000}\right)}</m> points the
      series converges to <m>10^{\left(10^{100000}\right)}</m>.  This
      is truly remarkable when you think of it this way.

    <p>
      At this point Cantor became more interested in these exceptional
      points than in the Fourier series problem that he<rsq/>d started
      with.  The next task he set for himself was to see just how
      general the set of exceptional points could be.  Following
      Cantor<rsq/>s lead we make the following definitions.

    <title>The Rise of Set Theory</title>

    <p>
      Cantor<rsq/>s work was instrumental in the re<ndash/>examination
      of the foundations of mathematics, whereby mathematical ideas
      were recast in the language of sets. Nowadays we do this
      naturally, so it doesn<rsq/>t seem profound, but recasting
      mathematics in terms of <term>Set Theory</term> has
      fundamentally shaped our modern approach.  We<rsq/>ve already
      seen this in <xref ref="def_accumulation-point"></xref>, <xref
      ref="PROBLEMAccumulationPoint"></xref>, and <xref
      ref="def_derived-set"></xref> where we recast Cantor<rsq/>s
      definition of a limit point into set theoretic terms.
    </p> 

    <p>
      It turns out that we can also rewrite concepts such as limits
      and continuity in terms of sets.  This led to a subject known as
      point set topology.  We will not present all of the ideas from
      topology as this would require an entire new course with an
      entire new book.  But we can give you a brief look at how
      analysis concepts are recast in  set theoretic form.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a set of real numbers <m>S</m> (not necessarily an
      interval) is called closed if it contains all of its limit
      points. Notice how similar this is to the definition of a closed
      interval. Since a closed interval contains all of its limit
      points (the endpoints), it is also a closed set.  To see this,
      we will show that any point not in <m>S=[a,b]</m> is not a limit
      point of <m>S</m>. 
      <!-- First, suppose <m>c\notin [a,b]</m>.  If -->

      The value of this reformulation of continuity (and similar
      definitions involving limits) in terms of open sets is that
      the concept of continuity can be generalized beyond the realm
      of real numbers to sets where the distance between points is
      either irrelevant or not even possible to determine. In
      <m>1914</m>, <url
      href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hausdorff/"
      >Felix Hausdorff</url> (1868<ndash/>1942) defined the concept
      of a <term>topology on a set</term>. His definition is based
      solely on sets and does not use the notion of distance
      or length which we have relied on hitherto. (The <m>\eps
      </m> and <m>\delta </m> that appeared in almost all of our
      convergence proofs measure a distance of some sort.)

      Given an arbitrary nonempty set <m>S</m>, we define a topology
      on <m>S</m> to be a collection <m>\tau </m> of subsets of
      <m>S</m> (which we designate to be the open sets).  The
      modern rendition of Hausdorff<rsq/>s definition of a topology
      says that <m>\tau </m> must satisfy the following axioms.
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>S</m> and <m>\emptyset </m> must be in <m>\tau </m>.

      Hausdorff actually added an extra <q>separation axiom</q>.

    <p>
      Nowadays, a topological space (that is a set with a topology

      <term>Hausdorff space</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This relatively simple idea generalizes our notion of open
      intervals in the real numbers and can be applied to a wide
      range of sets. We won<rsq/>t go into this very deeply, but we
      note that if we have a function <m>f:S\to T</m> from one
      topological space into another, we can define concepts like
      continuity by insisting that the preimage of any open set in
      the topology on <m>T</m> must be open in the topology on
      <m>S</m>.  It would be hard to overstate the impact of 
      generalizaions of this sort on modern mathematics.

    Our next theorem says that in a certain, very technical sense

    <xref ref="franks10__cantor_other_proof_rr_uncoun" />. This
    probably does not seem terribly significant.  After all, there
    are real numbers which are not counting numbers.  What will make
    this so startling is that the same cannot be said about all sets

    <!--   <m>S=\RR</m>.  Let <m>s_m</m> and <m>s_k</m> be the first two -->
    <!--   distinct elements of <m>S</m> such that <me> s_m, s_k \in -->
    <!--   \left(x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right) </me>. -->
    <!-- </p> -->
    <p>
      Next we assume that <m>\left[x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right]</m> has
      been constructed and build <m>\left[x_n, y_n\right]</m> as
      follows.  Observe that there are infinitely many elements of
      <m>S</m> in <m>\left(x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right)</m> since
      <m>S=\RR</m>.  Let <m>x_n</m> and <m>y_n</m> be the first two
      distinct elements of <m>S</m> such that <me> x_n, y_n \in
      \left(x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right) </me> with <m>x_n\lt y_n</m>.
      Then <m>\left[x_n,
      y_n\right]</m> is the <m>n</m>th interval.
    </p>

    <!-- <p> -->
    <!--   Take <m>x_n</m> to be the smaller and <m>y_n</m> to be the -->
    <!--   larger of <m>s_m</m> and <m>s_k</m>.  Then <m>\left[x_n, -->
    <!--   y_n\right]</m> is the <m>n</m>th interval. -->
    <!-- </p> -->

    <p>
      From the way we constructed them it is clear that <me>
      \left[x_1, y_1\right] \supseteq \left[x_2, y_2\right]
      \supseteq \left[x_3, y_3\right] \supseteq \ldots </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore by <xref ref="thm_WeakNIP"></xref> there is a
      real number, say <m>c</m>, such that <me> c\in\left[x_n,
      y_n\right] \text{ for all } n\in\NN </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, since <m>x_1\lt x_2\lt x_3\ldots\lt y_3\lt y_2\lt
      y_1</m> it is clear that
      <men xml:id="eq_NIP-interval">
        x_n\lt c\lt y_n, \ \forall n
        </men>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will show that <m>c</m> is the number we seek.  That the
      inequalities in <xref ref="eq_NIP-interval">formula</xref> are
      strict will play a crucial role.
    </p>

    <p>
      To see that <m>c\not\in S</m> we suppose that <m>c\in S</m>
      and derive a contradiction.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, suppose that <m>c=s_p</m> for some <m>p\in\NN</m>.  Then
      only <m>\left\{s_1, s_2,\ldots, s_{p-1}\right\}</m> appear
      before <m>s_p</m> in the sequence <m>S</m>.  Since each
      <m>x_n</m> is taken from <m>S</m> it follows that only
      finitely many elements of the sequence <m>(x_n)</m> appear
      before <m>s_p=c</m> in the sequence as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>x_l</m> be the last element of <m>(x_n)</m>
      which appears before <m>c=s_p</m> in the sequence and consider
      <m>x_{l+1}</m>.  The way it was constructed, <m>x_{l+1}</m>
      was one of the first two distinct terms in the sequence
      <m>S</m> strictly between <m>x_l</m> and <m>y_l</m>, the other
      being <m>y_{l+1}</m>.  Since <m>x_{l+1}</m> does not appear
      before <m>c=s_p</m> in the sequence and <m>x_l\lt c\lt
      y_l</m>, it follows that either <m>c=x_{l+1}</m> or
      <m>c=y_{l+1}</m>.  However, this gives us a contradiction as
      we know from <xref ref="eq_NIP-interval">formula</xref> that
      <m>x_{l+1}\lt c\lt y_{l+1}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus <m>c</m> is not an element of <m>S</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <p>
    So how does this theorem show that there are <q>more</q> real
    numbers than counting numbers?  Before we address that question
    we need to be very careful about the meaning of the word <q>more</q>
    when we<rsq/>re talking about infinite sets.
  </p>

  <p>
    First let<rsq/>s consider two finite sets, say
    <md>
      <mrow>        A=\left\{\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\right\}
      \amp{}\amp{}\text{and}\amp{}\amp{}B=\left\{a,b,c,d,e\right\}.</mrow>
    </md>
    How do we know that <m>B</m>
    is the bigger set? One way is to simply count
    the number of elements in both sets. Clearly <m>B</m>
    is  bigger since <m>\abs{A}=4</m> and <m>\abs{B}=5</m>
    and <m>4\lt 5</m>.  But we have no way of counting the number of elements of an
    infinite set.  Indeed, it isn<rsq/>t even clear what the phrase
    <q>the number of elements</q> might mean when applied
    to  an infinite set. So we need to find another way.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we count the number of elements in a finite set  we are 
    matching up the elements of the set with a set
    of consecutive positive integers, starting at <m>1</m>.  Thus
    since
    <md>
      <mrow>1\amp \leftrightarrow\alpha</mrow>
      <mrow>2\amp \leftrightarrow\beta</mrow>
      <mrow>3\amp \leftrightarrow\gamma</mrow>
      <mrow>4\amp \leftrightarrow\delta</mrow>
    </md>
    we see that <m>\abs{A}=4</m>.  Moreover, the order of the
    match<ndash/>up is unimportant.   Since
    <md>
      <mrow>2\amp \leftrightarrow e</mrow>
      <mrow>3\amp \leftrightarrow a</mrow>
      <mrow>5\amp \leftrightarrow b</mrow>
      <mrow>4\amp \leftrightarrow d</mrow>
      <mrow>1\amp \leftrightarrow c</mrow>
    </md>
    it is clear that the elements of <m>B</m> and the set
    <m>\left\{1,2,3,4,5\right\}</m> can be matched up as well.  And
    it doesn<rsq/>t matter what order either set is in.  They both have
    <m>5</m> elements.
  </p>

  <p>
    <idx><h>cardinality</h><h>definition</h></idx>

    Such a match<ndash/>up is called a one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one
    correspondence.  In general, if two sets can be put in
    one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence then they are the same
    <q>size.</q> Of course the word <q>size</q> has lots of
    connotations that will begin to get in the way when we talk
    about infinite sets, so instead we will say that the two sets
    have the same <term>cardinality</term>. Speaking loosely, this just
    means that they are the same size.
  </p>

  <p> 
    More precisely, if a given set <m>S</m> can be put in
    one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence with a finite set of
    consecutive integers beginning at <m>1</m>, say
    <m>\left\{1,2,3,\ldots, N\right\}</m>, then we say that the
    cardinality of the set is <m>N</m>.  But again, the precise statement is  that
    both sets have the same cardinality.  It is this notion of
    one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence, along with the next two
    definitions, which will allow us to compare the sizes
    (cardinalities) of infinite sets.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Any set which can be put into one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence with
        <m>\NN=\left\{1,2,3,\ldots\right\}</m> is called a
        <term>countably infinite</term> set.  Any set which is
        either finite or countably infinite is said to be
        <term>countable</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>




  <p>
    <idx><h>Cantor, Georg</h></idx>

    Since <m>\NN</m> is an infinite set, we have no symbol to
    designate its cardinality so we have to invent one.  The symbol
    used by Cantor and adopted by mathematicians ever since is
    <m>\aleph_0</m>.  Thus the cardinality of any countably infinite
    set is <m>\aleph_0</m>.
  </p>

  <aside>
    <title>: <m>\boldsymbol\aleph_0</m></title>

      <m>\aleph{}</m> is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet and
      is pronounced <q>aleph.</q> <m>\aleph_0</m> is pronounced
    <q>aleph null.</q></p>

  <p>
    We have already given the following definition informally.  We
    include it formally here for later reference.

  <p>
    <idx><h>infinite sets</h><h>uncountable</h></idx>

    With these two definitions in place we can see that <xref
    ref="thm_NoSeriesContainsAllReals"></xref> is nothing more nor
    less than the statement that <m>\RR{}</m> is not countably
    infinite since it is certainly not finite and the subscripts
    identify a one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence. In that case
    we say that the set of real numbers is <term>uncountably
    infinite</term> or just <term>uncountable</term>. Speaking
    loosely we say that <m>\RR </m> is <q>bigger</q> than the
    natural numbers.

  <aside xml:id="SizeVsCardinality">
    <title>
      Size vs. Cardinality
    </title>
    <p>
      It is natural to use the word <q>size</q> in the context of
      infinite sets but <q>size</q> conjures up a mental image that
      really doesn<rsq/>t apply. This is why we use
      <q>cardinality</q>. For example all of the sets in <xref

      cardinality. Would you say they are the same size?

  <p>
    To see this let us suppose first that each real number appears
    in the sequence <m>(s_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> at least once.  In
    that case the indexing of our sequence is really just a
    one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence between the elements of
    the sequence and <m>\NN:</m>

      <mrow>1\amp \leftrightarrow s_1</mrow>

  <p>
    Therefore <m>\left(s_n\right)_{n=1}^\infty </m> is countable.
    But <xref ref="thm_NoSeriesContainsAllReals" ></xref> says that
    no sequence in <m>\RR</m> includes all of <m>\RR</m>.  Therefore

    It seems that no matter what we do the only example we can find

    But wait!  Remember the rational numbers?  They were similar to
    the real numbers in many ways.  Perhaps they are uncountably
    infinite too?

    Alas, no.  The rational numbers turn out to be countable too.

    All of our efforts to build an uncountable set from a countable
    one have come to nothing.  In fact many sets that at first
    <q>feel</q> like they should be uncountable are not. This makes
    the uncountability of <m>\RR</m> all the more remarkable.

  <p>    
    The failure is in the methods we<rsq/>ve used so far.  It is

    we<rsq/>re clever enough, but this would take us too far away from
    our main topic so we won<rsq/>t pursue it.
    Do you see how it might be done?

    Of particular note is the work of <url
    href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Stieltjes/"
    >Thomas Jan Stieltjes</url> (1856-1894). While working on the
    problem of determining the mass distribution of an object given
    that the moments of all orders of a body are given (called the
    moment problem) he defined a slight generalization of the Riemann
    integral which was published in his work <foreign>Recherches sur
    les fractions continues</foreign> (Research on Continued
    Fractions) in <m>1894</m>.
    <!-- If you are acquainted -->
    <!-- with probability theory, the first moment of a probability density -->
    <!-- function is the expected value, the second moment (about the mean) -->
    <!-- is the variance, etc.  The problem is to reconstruct the -->
    <!-- probability density function from these moments.   -->

    You are already acquainted with the underlying idea of a
    Stieltjes integral. You just don<rsq/>t know it by this name.
    Consider for example,
    <men xml:id="EQUATIONStieltjesExampIntX">
      \int^2_{x=0}{\sin\left(x^2\right)2x\dx{x}}
      </men>.

      We recognize that the computed value of <xref
      ref="EQUATIONStieltjesExampIntX" >formula</xref> will be the
      same as the computed value of integral

      <men  xml:id="EQUATIONStieltjesExampIntY">
        \int^2_{x=0}{\sin(u)} \dx(u)
      </men>
      if <m>u=x^2</m>          .

      In both <xref ref="EQUATIONStieltjesExampIntX">formula</xref> and <xref ref="EQUATIONStieltjesExampIntY" >formula</xref>
      <!-- <me>\int^2_{x=0}{\sin\left(x^2\right)2x\dx{x}}</me>. -->
      <!-- <me>\int^1_{u=0}{{\sin -->
      <!-- \left(u\right)}\ du}</me> -->
      we can think of the differential <m>\dx{x}</m> as representing
      the <q>width</q> (or <q>measure</q>) of the infinitely thin
      rectangles whose areas are to be summed. But it is clear
      that <m>\dx{x}\neq \dx{u}</m>. There must be some
      relationship between the two differentials that adjusts for
      the change in variables.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since <m>u=x^2</m> clearly <m>\dx{u} = 2x\dx{x}</m>. It is this
    relation between the differentials that keeps the integrals equal.
  </p>

  <!--       </me> -->
  <!--       we see that the width of the areas <m>\dx(x^2)</m> changes -->
  <!--       depending on the value of <m>x</m>.  Those closer to one carry -->
  <!--       more weight, or are denser, than those closer to zero: -->

  <!--         </mrow> -->
  <!--       </md> -->
  <!--       To simplify our notation we set <m>u=x^2</m> so that <m>\dx{u}=2x\dx{x}</m> and the integral becomes  -->

  <!--   Of course you recognize this as the integration technique called <term>integration by substitution</term> in most Calculus textbooks. -->

  <!--       re<ndash/>interpret our notation a bit. In particular we need to -->
  <!--       re<ndash/>think the role of the differentials <m>\dx{x}</m> and -->

    This relation is visualized geometrically in <xref
    ref="FIGUREStieltjesDX" ></xref> and <xref ref="FIGUREStieltjesDY"
    ></xref> where  the interval <m>[0,2]</m> is partitioned into
    subintervals of length <m>\dx{x}</m> and of length <m>\dx{u}</m>,
    respectively.

  <p> Strictly speaking, the intervals in <xref
  ref="FIGUREStieltjesDY" ></xref> are all the same length (since
  they are all of length <m>\dx{u}</m>) just as in <xref
  ref="FIGUREStieltjesDX" ></xref>. We<rsq/>ve drawn them with
  increasing lengths to emphasize that we are measuring the
  distance of a point from the origin in two distinct ways.  </p>
  <p> This is a bizarre idea so we will proceed slowly.  </p> <p>
  Notice that the (absolute value of the) coordinate of a point on
  the line gives the distance from the origin to the point.
  The
  usual way to measure the length between arbitrary points on the
  real line is to take the absolute value of the difference of
  their coordinates. Thus between <m>x</m> and <m>x+\dx{x}</m> the
  length is <m>\abs{\dx{x}}</m>.  Similarly the length between
  <m>u</m> and <m>u+\dx{u}</m> is <m>\abs{\dx{u}}</m>. As long as
  we work with the <m>u-</m>coordinate system this is fine but if
  we want to move between the <m>u-</m>coordinates and the
  <m>x-</m>coordinates we must use the relation

  <me>
    \dx{u}=2x\dx{x}
  </me>

  to adjust appropriately between <m>\dx{x}</m> and
  <m>\dx{u}</m>. That is what <xref ref="FIGUREStieltjesDY"
  ></xref> depicts. We<rsq/>ve drawn the intervals in the
  <m>x-</m>coordinates, but we<rsq/>ve labeled them with
  <m>u-</m>coordinates. That<rsq/>s why they don<rsq/>t appear to
  be the same length.

<aside>
  <title>
    Is This Rigorous?
  </title>
  <p>
    No, obviously it is not and we won<rsq/>t pretend that it
    is. In particular we haven<rsq/>t even stated a definition
    for the differentials <m>\dx{x}</m> or <m>\dx{y}</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we observed in <xref ref="NumbersRealRational" ></xref>
    Abraham Robinson built a rigorous theory of differentials in
    his book <pubtitle> Non<ndash/>Standard Analysis</pubtitle>
    <xref ref="robinson74__non_stand_analy" />. But we have
    relied on the older limit theory so nothing we do with
    differentials can be considered rigorous. You should think
    of the use of differentials as an aid to intuition, as a
    useful <q>way of thinking</q>. But to be considered
    thoroughly rigorous any insight gained from the use of
    differentials must be justified either using the theory of
    limits or Robinson<rsq/>s Non<ndash/>Standard Analysis.
  </p>
</aside>

<p>
  Just as we replaced the word <q>size</q> with
  <q>cardinality</q> when working with infinite sets we
  replace the word <q>length</q> with <q>measure</q> in this
  context. The word <q>length</q> has too many associations
  that can trip us up if we<rsq/>re not careful. So the
  measures of subintervals in our partition are being
  generated in different ways. When we work in the
  <m>u-</m>coordinate system the length of the interval
  <m>\dx{u} </m> at <m>u=x^2</m> is given by
  <m>\dx{u}=2x\dx{x}</m>. The function <m>u(x)=x^2</m> is our  <term>measure</term> function.

<p>
  Because <xref ref="DEFINITIONStieljesIntegral" ></xref>

  Integral</term> it is easy to get the impression that it
  is equivalent to <term>integration by substitution</term>
  and nothing more. But Stieltjes<rsq/> original efforts
  were a little more general than that. He was working on
  the moment problem we described at the beginning of this
  section. His integral allowed him to address that problem
  more simply than the Riemann integral would allow. The
  <term>Stieltjes Integral</term> is also useful in
  probability and physics, in places where <m>f</m> has jump
  discontinuities, and is generalizable to a functional
  analysis setting where the <q>points</q> are actually
  functions. But all of this is well beyond the scope of
  this text.
</p>
<p>
  We focused on the notion of the <term>measure</term> of a
  set as distinct from the length of an interval because the
  <term>measure</term> of a set is the foundational idea
  that we will need to introduce our next topic, the
  <term>Lebesgue Integral</term>.

    <p>
      In our side comment, <xref ref="SizeVsCardinality"
      text="title"></xref> we noted that the mental image evoked by the
      word <q>size</q> isn<rsq/>t really appropriate when discussing
      infinite sets because two sets can have the same cardinality even
      though the first completely contains the second, with some left
      over. For example <m>\ZZ </m> contains all of <m>\NN{}</m>, and
      all of the negative integers as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a similar problem with the concept of length. Two intervals
      can have the same length even as one completely contains the other,
      with some left over. For example, <m>[0,1]</m> contains all of the
      points in <m>(0,1)</m> in addition to <m>0</m> and
      <m>1</m>. Moreover <q>length</q> is only applicable to intervals
      which are a very specific kind of set.  We will need to be able to
      compute the <q>length</q> of more general sets. To avoid
      confusion we need to use a word other than <q>length</q>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Historically,  the word that has been chosen  is <term>measure</term>. If <m>S</m> is a set of real numbers then <m> \mu
      (S)</m> denotes the <term>measure</term> of <m>S</m>.

      The purpose of
      the first and third statements should be clear.  Since we are
      looking to generalize the concept of length the
      <term>measure</term> of an interval should be its length. For
      example,
      <me>
        \mu
        \left( (a,b)\right) = \mu \left( [a,b]\right) =  \mu \left(
        [a,b)\right) =\mu \left( (a,b]\right) =b-a
        </me>, 
        and if <m>\gamma{}\in\RR{}</m>
        <me>
          \mu
          \left( (a,b)\right) = \mu \left( a+\gamma{},b+\gamma{}])\right) = b-a
          </me>, 
    </p>
    <p>
      The second statement is the <xref ref="TriangleIneq"
      text="custom">Triangle Inequalty</xref> dressed up in the language
      of sets and measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conditions given in <xref ref="DEFINITIONMeasureFunction"
      ></xref> are modeled on properties of lengths (of intervals) but
      if that<rsq/>s all we are interested in there is no need to make
      this definition. These properties are easily proven if
      <m>\mu{}</m> is length and the only sets we measure are
      intervals. This definition is here because we want measure other
      kinds of sets in <m>\RR{}</m>. For example using this definition
      we can compute <m>\mu (\ZZ )</m>,  <m>\mu (\NN{}) </m> and
      <m>\mu (\QQ) </m>. What would you guess each of these will be?
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that <xref ref="DEFINITIONMeasureFunction" ></xref> does not
      require that <m>\mu{}</m> be unique. In fact many measure functions
      have been, and can be defined on <m>\RR{}</m>, but for our purposes
      we only need to touch lightly on one of them, the <term>Lebesgue
      measure</term>, first introduced by <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Lebesgue/" >
      Henri
      Lebesgue</url> (1875-1941) in his doctoral dissertation 
      <pubtitle>
        Intégrale, longueur, aire 
        </pubtitle> (Integral, length, area) <m>1902</m>. By <q>touch lightly</q> we mean that we will only
        actually define the so<ndash/>calle <term>outer measure</term> from
        which Lebegue<rsq/>s measure follows. That will be enough for our
        purposes.

      That we called <m>\lambda_o (S)</m> and <term>outer</term> measure

      A couple of observations regarding this notation will be helpful here.
      <ul  marker="disc">
        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>[b-a]</m> and <m>\lambda_o</m> both represent numbers
            the first subtraction in <xref ref="EQUATIONInnerMeasure"
            >equation</xref> is just ordinary subtraction.
          </p>
        </li>    
        <li>
          <p>
            The expression <m>[a,b]</m> normally means the interval from
            <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> which means that the points in the
            interval are ordered, but we are abusing our notation a bit by
            thinking of it simply as an unordered set. In that case the
            expression <m>[a,b] - S</m> represents set deletion rather
            than ordinary subtraction. It represents the set of points
            between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> (inclusive) with the points in
            <m>S</m> deleted.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The names of the inner and outer measures are descriptive. To
      compute <m>\lambda _o</m> we consider a set of numbers generated by
      a collection of sets which contain <m>S</m>. To compute
      <m>\lambda_i</m> we consider a set of numbers generated by a
      collection of sets which are contained within <m>S</m>. When these
      are the same we have the <term>Lebesgue Measure</term>.

      Because the <term>Lebesgue Measure</term> depends on the notion of an infimum, the possibility of an non<ndash/>measureable set exists. 
      The first non<ndash/>measurable set was described
      by 
      <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Vitali/" >
        Giuseppe Vitali</url> (1875-1932) in <m>1905</m>.  Creating such
        a set requires the use of something called the <term>Axiom of
        Choice</term> and delves deeply into a careful study of the
        theory of sets.  We will see how complicated sets can be in the
        next section.

      The Lesbegue Integral
    </title>



    <p>
      A primary objective of this text is to convey to you, the student,
      an appreciation for, and an understanding of, the need for
      rigor. That objective remains in force. However, in this section
      we are at the edge of very deep mathematical waters. Until we
      start the next section we will only be wading in the shallows.  We
      will thus relax our relentless emphasis on rigor for now.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest of this section we will set rigor to the side and
      instead appeal to your intuition by the use of sketches. We will
      also reason by analogy rather than precisely (e.g., using <m>\eps
      </m>) and <m>\delta{}</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, for the remainder of this section we will assume that
      all of the functions we will consider are positive so that we can
      safely engage your strong intuitive understanding of area. We do
      this because our goal here is only to give you a sense of how
      Lesbegue broadened Cauchy<rsq/>s definition of the integral. In
      particular we will not develop Lebesgue<rsq/>s integral in
      detail. Should you desire a deeper understanding than you<rsq/>ll
      get here a second course in Real Analysis is highly recommended.

      <!-- <idx><h>Dirichlet<rsq/>s Function</h></idx> -->

      Recall from <xref ref="PROBLEMDirichletCountrExamp" ></xref>
      that the <term>Dirichlet Function</term>
      <me> 
        D(x)=
        \begin{cases}
        0, \amp \text{ if }  x \text{ is irrational}\\
        1, \amp \text{ if }  x \text{ is rational}
        \end{cases}

      is not Riemann (Cauchy, Darboux) integrable. Dirichlet invented
      his function as an example of a non<ndash/>integrable
      function. For our purposes it has no importance beyond
      that. However the existence of non<ndash/>(Riemann)integrable
      functions suggests the question: Can the integral be defined in
      such a way as to capture all of the intuitive features of
      (Riemann) integration known to <m>18</m>th century mathematicians
      and which also allows us to integrate something as seemingly
      bizarre as the Dirichlet Function?
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer, of course, is yes. Otherwise we wouldn<rsq/>t have
      asked. Lebesgue defined such an integral at he turn of the twentieth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking very loosely, if we want to compute
      <m>\int_a^bf(x)\dx{x} </m> where <m>f(x)\ge 0</m> using the
      Riemann (Cauchy) integral we partition the <m>x-</m>axis into
      adjacent intervals with width <m>\dx{x}</m> and then construct
      (infinitesimal) rectangles with area 

      <me>
        f(x)\dx{x} 
      </me> 
      from each differential. Summing these areas <mdash/> computing
      <m> \int_a^b f(x)\dx{x} </m> <mdash/> provides the value
      of the definite integral.
    </p> 

    <p>
      <!--   To compute the area of the rectangle -->
      <!-- constructed at <m>x</m> we need its height, <m>f(x)</m>, and its -->
      <!-- width, <m>\dx{x}</m>.   -->
      <!-- </p> -->

      <!-- <p> -->
      <!--   Rather -->
      <!--   than summing the areas of the rectangle one at a time proceeding -->
      <!--   from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>  -->
      <!--   came up with a different approach -->


      Lebesgue<rsq/>s idea was to find all rectangles with a common
      height first, gather them together, and sum those areas. In letter
      to a colleague he described his process as follows:
    </p>
    <blockquote>

      <p>
        <q>I have to pay a certain sum, which I have collected
        in my pocket. I take the bills and coins out of my
        pocket and give them to the creditor in the order I
        find them until I have reached the total sum. This is
        the Riemann integral. But I can proceed
        differently. After I have taken all the money out of
        my pocket I order the bills and coins according to
        identical values and then I pay the several heaps one
        after the other to the creditor. This is my integral.</q>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      To see how this worked suppose we want to integrate
      <m>f(x)=\abs{\sin x}</m> from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=\pi{}</m> as seen in <xref ref="FIGURELebegInt1" ></xref> below.
    </p>


    <figure  xml:id="FIGURELebegInt1">
      <caption>In Lebesgue<rsq/>s integral we find the area of each
      colored region first. Notice that there are <m>29</m> regions,
      including the two very thin red regions and three regions with
      zero height located at <m>x=0</m>, <m>x=\pi{}</m>, and
      <m>x=2\pi{}</m>.  </caption>
      <image source="images/LebInt2.png" width="100%">
        <shortdescription></shortdescription>

    </figure>

    <p>
      In a Riemann integral we start at <m>x=0</m>, compute the first blue
      area, add to that the first green area, and so on, until we reach
      <m>x=2\pi </m> where we add in the last blue area. Notice that area of
      the first blue rectangle is the height of <m>f(x)</m> multiplied by
      the measure of interval on the <m>x-</m>axis which corresponds to
      the interval <m>\left[ \frac17, \frac27 \right]{}</m> on the
      <m>y-</m>axis. We<rsq/>ll designate that area with
      <m>\mu{(1)}</m>. Similarly <m>\mu (2)</m> represents the measure of
      the base of the first green rectangle, and so on for all <m>26</m>
      regions. (Don<rsq/>t forget the thin red regions. We<rsq/>ll get
      back to those in a bit.)
    </p>
    <p>
      But nothing says we must add the areas in this order. This is just a
      convention. Lebesgue<rsq/>s ideas was to compute the area of all of
      the blue regions together, then all of the green regions, then the
      orange, and so on. By rearranging the sum this way the total are of
      the blue regions is,

      <me>
        f(1/7)\mu (1) +f(1/7)\mu (13) +f(1/7)\mu (14) +f(1/7)\mu
        (28)
      </me>
      or 
      <me>
        f(1/7)\underbrace{\left[ \mu (1) +\mu (13) +\mu (14)
        +\mu(28)\right]}_{=\Lambda_b} 
        </me>.

        The expression <m>\left( \mu (1) +\mu (13) +\mu (14)
        +\mu(28)\right)</m> then represents the total measure of the bases
        on the <m>x-</m>axis of the blue regions which we designate
        <m>\Lambda_b</m>. <m>\Lambda_b</m> is the Lebesgue measure of the
        base of all of the blue regions. Similarly the Lebesgue measure of
        the dark green, orange, light green, purple,  yellow, and red regions are
        <m>\Lambda_d</m>, <m>\Lambda_o</m>, <m>\Lambda_l</m>,
        <m>\Lambda_p</m>,  <m>\Lambda_y</m>, and <m>\Lambda_r</m> respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our integral is thus 
      <md>
        <mrow>  
          \int_{x=0}^{2 \pi}f(x)\dx{x}=f(1/7)\Lambda_b + f(2/7)\Lambda_d \amp{}+
          f(3/7)\Lambda_o
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp{} + f(4/7)\Lambda_l + f(5/7)\Lambda_p + f(6/7)\Lambda_y 
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      But wait a minute! What about the two thin red regions and the ones
      at <m>x=0</m>, <m>x=\pi{}</m>, and <m>x=2 \pi{}</m>? Why did we leave them out?
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be clear that the measure of these regions must be
      zero. Do you see why?  The only places on our graph where <m>f(x) =
      1</m> are at the two maxima, and the base of any rectangle
      constructed there will have measure zero, <m>\Lambda_r = 0</m>. This
      is clear from the sketch. Moreover in light of part (a) of <xref
      ref="PROBLEMOuterMeasure1" ></xref>. A single point on the
      <m>x-</m>axis has measure zero.

      Thus
      the <q>area</q> of those regions will be <m>1\cdot \Lambda_0 =
      1\cdot 0 = 0</m>. Those points in the domain of our function
      contribute nothing to the integral.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same is true of the rectangles constructed at <m>x=0</m>,
      <m>x=\pi{}</m>, and <m>x=2\pi{}</m>. The measures of their bases
      will be zero. (Their heights will also be zero but that is
      irrelevant.)

    <!-- <p> -->
    <!--   Given that Cantor had shown that the set of rational numbers is -->
    <!--   countable while the set of irrational numbers is uncountable, -->
    <!--   Lebesgue thought that the value of <m>f\left(x\right)</m> on a -->
    <!--   relatively <q>small</q> set such as the rational numbers should -->
    <!--   have no bearing (or at least very little) on the value of an integral so he focused -->
    <!--   more on measuring the relative <q>sizes</q> of different sets in the -->

    <p>
      In Lebesgue<rsq/>s scheme there is always the possibility that after
      rearranging our rectangles the measure of the base of a region might
      be zero.  <xref ref="FIGURELebegInt1" ></xref> shows two ways that
      can happen but there are many others. In particular, <xref
      ref="THEOREMMeasureZero" ></xref> shows that it is possible for an
      infinite set to have measure zero.  This has repurcussions for the
      integral of Dirichlet<rsq/>s function,

      <me>

      we need only partition the <m>y-</m>axis in two places, <m>y=0</m>
      and <m>y=1</m>. Gathering all of the rectangles together in the same way we did  above  we see that

  <title>Cantor<rsq/>s Theorem and Its Consequences</title>



  <p>
    After employing his ideas on infinite sets of real numbers to
    study trigonometric series, Cantor gravitated toward applying
    his ideas to sets in general.  For example, once he showed
    that there were two types of infinity (countable and
    uncountable), the following question was natural, <q>Do all
    uncountable sets have the same cardinality?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Just like not all <q>non<ndash/>dogs</q> are cats, there is,
    <foreign>a priori</foreign>, no reason to believe that all
    uncountable sets should be the same size.  However constructing
    uncountable sets of different sizes is not as easy as it sounds.

    <idx>
      <h>Cantor, Georg</h>
      <h>unit interval and unit square have equal cardinalty</h>
    </idx>
    
    For example, what about the line segment represented by the
    interval <m>[0,1]</m> and the square represented by the set
    <m>[0,1]\times[0,1]=\left\{(x,y)|0\leq x,y\leq 1\right\}</m>.
    Certainly the two dimensional square must be a larger infinite
    set than the one dimensional line segment.  Remarkably, Cantor
    showed that these two sets were the same cardinality.  In his
    1877 correspondence of this result to his friend and fellow
    mathematician, <url
    href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Dedekind/"
    >Richard
    Dedekind</url>, (1831<ndash/>1915) even Cantor remarked, <q>I see
    it, but I don<rsq/>t believe it!</q>

  <p>
    The following argument illustrates the idea of Cantor<rsq/>s
    proof.  Cantor devised the following function
    <m>f:[0,1]\times[0,1]\rightarrow [0,1]</m>.  First, we represent
    the coordinates of any point <m>(x,y)\in [0,1]\times[0,1]</m> by
    their decimal representations <m>x=0.a_1 a_2 a_3\cdots</m> and
    <m>y=0.b_1 b_2 b_3\cdots</m>.  Even terminating decimals can be
    written this way as we could write <m>0.5=0.5000\cdots</m>.  We
    can then define <m>f(x,y)</m> by <me> f((0.a_1 a_2 a_3\cdots
    ,0.b_1 b_2 b_3\cdots))=0.a_1 b_1 a_2 b_2 a_3 b_3\cdots </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This relatively simple idea has some technical difficulties in
    it related to the following result.
  </p>

  <problem>
    <idx><h>Problems</h><h>Geometric series</h></idx>

    
    <idx><h>series</h><h>Geometric series</h><h>

    <m>(0.\bar{9})</m> converges to <m>1</m></h></idx> 
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the sequence <m>(0.9,0.99,0.999,\cdots)</m>.
        Determine that this sequence converges and, in fact, it
        converges to <m>1</m>.  This suggests that
        <m>0.999\cdots=1</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    Similarly, we have <m>0.04999\cdots=0.05000\cdots</m>, etc.  To
    make the decimal representation of a real number in <m>[0,1]</m>
    unique, we must make a consistent choice of writing a
    terminating decimal as one that ends in an infinite string of
    zeros or an infinite string of nines [with the one exception
    <m>0=0.000\cdots</m> ]. No matter which choice we make, we could
    never make this function onto.  For example,
    <m>109/1100=0.09909090\cdots</m> would have as its pre-image
    <m>(0.0999\cdots,0.9000\cdots)</m> which would be a mix of the
    two conventions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cantor was able to overcome this technicality and demonstrate a
    one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence, but rather than go into
    that we will simply assert that using either convention it is
    possible to show that the function is one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one. As
    a result the set <m>[0,1]\times[0,1]</m> has the same cardinality
    as some <m>[0,1]</m> which is an uncountable subset of <m>\RR</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    That they both have the same cardinality as <m>\RR</m> itself is
    something we will come back to.  But first we<rsq/>ll try
    construct an uncountable set which does not have the same
    cardinality as <m>\RR</m>.  To address this issue, Cantor proved
    the following in <m>1891</m>.

  <p>
    Actually it turns out that <m>\RR</m> and <m>P(\NN)</m> have the
    same cardinality.  This can be seen in a roundabout way using some
    of the ideas from <xref ref="prob_PowerSet"></xref>.
    Specifically, let <m>T</m> be the set of all sequences of zeros or
    ones. <!--  Then it -->
    <!-- is straightforward to see that <m>T</m> and <m>P(\NN)</m> have the -->
    <!-- same cardinality. -->
  </p>

  <p>
    The half<ndash/>open interval <m>(0,1]</m> has the same
    cardinality as <m>\RR</m> and we can show that it has the same
    cardinality as <m>T</m> as well by expressing them in binary form.
    Specifically every real number in <m>[0,1]</m> can be written as
    <me>
      \displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^\infty \frac{a_j}{2^j} =0.a_1a_2a_3\cdots
    </me>
    where <m>a_j\in\left\{0,1\right\}</m>.  We have to account for
    the fact that binary representations such as <m>0.0111\cdots</m>
    and <m>0.1000\cdots</m> represent the same real number (say that
    no representations will end in an infinite string of zeros),
    then we can see that <m>[0,1]</m> has the same cardinality as
    <m>T-U</m>, where <m>U</m> is the set of all sequences ending in
    an infinite string of zeros.  It turns out that <m>U</m> itself
    is a countable set.

    As we indicated before, Cantor<rsq/>s  work on infinite sets had a profound impact on
    mathematics in the beginning of the twentieth century.  For
    example, in examining the proof of Cantor<rsq/>s Theorem, the
    eminent logician 
    <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Russell/" >Bertrand Russell</url> (1872<ndash/>1970) devised his famous paradox in
    1901.

  <p>
    Through the work of Cantor and others, sets were becoming a
    central object of study in mathematics.  Mathematical
    concepts were being reformulated in terms of sets, as we saw in
    <xref ref="SECTIONRiseSetTheory" ></xref>.  The idea was that set
    theory was to be a unifying theme of mathematics but
    Russell<rsq/>s paradox set the mathematical world on its ear
    because it showed that the naive understanding of a set as <q>just a
    collection of objects</q> leads to logical difficulties.
  </p>

  <fact xml:id="RussellParadox">
    
    <idx><h>Russell<rsq/>s Paradox</h></idx>

    <p>
      Consider the set of all sets
      which are not elements of themselves.  We call this set <m>D</m>
      and ask, <q>Is <m>D\in D?</m></q> Symbolically, this set is <me>
      D=\{S\ |\ S\not \in S\} </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If <m>D\in D</m>, then by definition, <m>D\not\in D</m>.  If
      <m>D\not\in D</m>, then by definition, <m>D\in D</m>.
    </p>
  </fact>

  <p>
    The idea behind <xref ref="RussellParadox" text="custom">Russell<rsq/>s
    Paradox</xref> is essentially the same idea that gave us a
    contradiction in our proof of <xref ref="thm_CantorsTheorem"
    text="custom" >Cantor<rsq/>s Theorem</xref>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To have such a
    contradiction occurring at the most basic level of mathematics was
    scandalous.  It forced a number of mathematicians and logicians to
    carefully devise the axioms by which sets could be constructed.
    To be honest, most mathematicians still approach set theory from a
    naive point of view as the sets we typically deal with fall under
    the category of what we would call <q>normal sets.</q> In fact,
    such an approach is officially called <term>Naive Set Theory</term> (as opposed
    to <url

    >Axiomatic Set Theory</url>).  However, attempts to put set theory
    and logic on solid footing led to the modern study of symbolic
    logic and ultimately the design of computer (machine) logic.

    Another place where Cantor<rsq/>s work had a profound influence in
    modern logic comes from something we alluded to before.  We showed
    before that the unit square <m>[0,1]\times [0,1]</m> had the same
    cardinality as an uncountable subset of <m>\RR</m>.  In fact,
    Cantor showed that the unit square had the same cardinality as
    <m>\RR</m> itself and was moved to advance the following in <m>1878</m>.

    <statement>

      <p>
        Every uncountable subset of <m>\RR</m> has the same
        cardinality as <m>\RR</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </conjecture>

    Cantor was unable to prove or disprove the <xref
    ref="ContinuumHypothesis" text="custom">Continuum
    Hypothesis</xref> conjecture (along with every other mathematician
    at the time). In fact, proving or disproving the Continuum
    Hypothesis, was one of <url

    >David Hilbert<rsq/>s</url> famous <url

    >23 problems</url> which he presented as a challenge for the
    mathematics community at the <url

    Since <m>\RR</m> has the same cardinality as <m>P(\NN)</m>, the
    <xref ref="ContinuumHypothesis" text="custom">Continuum
    Hypothesis</xref> was generalized to the:
  </p>

  <conjecture xml:id="GenContHyp">
    <title>The Generalized Continuum Hypothesis</title>
    
    <idx><h>Continuum Hypothesis</h><h>generalized</h></idx>

    <statement>

      <p>
        Given an infinite set <m>S</m>, there is no infinite set
        which has a cardinality strictly between that of <m>S</m>
        and its power set <m>P(S)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </conjecture>

  <p>
    Efforts to prove or disprove <xref ref="GenContHyp" ></xref> were
    in vain and with good reason.  In <m>1940</m>, the logician <url
    href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Godel/"
    >Kurt Gödel</url> showed that the Continuum Hypothesis could not
    be disproved from the
    
    <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory" >Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms</url> of set theory.  In 1963, 
    <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Cohen/" >Paul Cohen</url> (1934<ndash/>2007)
    showed that the Continuum Hypothesis could not be proved using
    the Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms, either.  In other words, the
    Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms do not contain enough information to
    decide the truth of the hypothesis.

  <p>
    We are willing to bet that at this point your head might be
    swimming a bit.  If so, then know that these are the same feelings
    that the mathematical community experienced in the
      mid<ndash/>twentieth century.  In the past, mathematics was seen
      as a model of logical certainty.  It is disconcerting to find that
      there are statements that are <term>undecidable</term>. In fact, Gödel
      proved in <m>1931</m> that a consistent finite axiom system that
      contained the axioms of arithmetic would always contain
      undecidable statements which could neither be proved true nor
      false with those axioms.  Mathematical knowledge would always be
      incomplete.
    </p>



    <p>
      So by trying to put the foundations of Calculus on solid ground,
      we have come to a point where we can never obtain mathematical
      certainty.  Does this mean that we should throw up our hands and
      concede defeat?  Should we be paralyzed with fear of trying
      anything?  Certainly not!  As we mentioned before, most
      mathematicians do well by taking a pragmatic approach. We use the
      mathematics we know and understand to solve the problems we
      encounter as best we can.  In fact, it is typically the problems
      that motivate the mathematics.  It is true that we take chances
      that don<rsq/>t always pan out, but still we take those chances,
      often with success.  Even when the successes lead to more
      questions, as they typically do, tackling those questions usually
      leads to a deeper understanding.  At the very least, our
      incomplete understanding means we will always have more questions
      to answer, more problems to solve.
