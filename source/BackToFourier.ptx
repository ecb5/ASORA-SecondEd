  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we have seen, when they converge, power series are very well
      behaved.  The fact Fourier (trigonometric) series weren<rsq/>t
      always well behaved was a puzzle and it made them a lightning
      rod for mathematical study in the nineteenth century.
    </p>

    <p> 
      For example, consider the question of uniqueness.  We saw in
      <xref ref="TaylorSeries"></xref> that if a function could
      be represented by a power series, then that series must be the
      Taylor series.  More precisely, if <me> f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty
      a_n(x-a)^n </me>, then <me> a_n=\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}  </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      But what can be said about the uniqueness of a trigonometric
      series?  If we can represent a function <m>f</m> as a general
      trigonometric series <me> f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty(a_n\cos n\pi
      x\,+b_n\sin n\pi x) </me>, then must this be the Fourier series
      with the coefficients as determined by Fourier?
    <idx><h>Fourier, Jean Baptiste Joseph</h></idx> 
    </p>

    <p>
      If 
      <me>
        \sum_{n=0}^\infty(a_n\cos n\pi x\,+b_n\sin n\pi x)
      </me>
      converges to <m>f</m> uniformly on the interval <m>(0,1)</m>
      then <mdash/> because of the uniform convergence <mdash/>
      Fourier<rsq/>s term<ndash/>by<ndash/>term integration is
      perfectly legitimate. Moreover the coefficients will of
      necessity be the coefficients computed in <xref
      ref="EQUATIONSineCoeffFourier">equation</xref> and <xref
      ref="EQUATIONCosineCoeffFourier" >equation</xref> .  However we
      have seen that the convergence of a Fourier series need not be
      uniform.  This does not mean that we cannot integrate
      term<ndash/>by<ndash/>term, but it does say that we can<rsq/>t
      be sure that term<ndash/>by<ndash/>term integration of a Fourier
      series will yield the integral of the associated function.

    <p>
      <idx><h>Lebesgue, Henri</h></idx> 
      <idx><h>Cantor, Georg</h></idx> 

      This led to a generalization of the integral by 
      <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Lebesgue/" visual="mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Lebesgue/">Henri Lebesgue</url>
      in 1905.  Lebesgue<rsq/>s profound work settled the question: <q>Is
      a bounded pointwise converging trigonometric series the
      Fourier series of a function?</q> We will (very briefly) describe some of 
      Lebesgue<rsq/>s work in <xref ref="SECTIONLebesgMeas" ></xref>.
    </p>
      <p>
        But before we can do that we will need to understand the
        pioneering work of <url
        href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Cantor/"
        visual="mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Cantor/">Georg
        Cantor</url> (1845<ndash/>1918) on <term>Set Theory</term> in the late 19th
        century.
        Cantor<rsq/>s work was also profound and had far reaching
        implications in modern mathematics.  It also leads to some
        seemingly very weird conclusions.

      <aside>
        
        <p>
          <lsq/>Weird<rsq/> does not mean false.  It simply means that
          some of Cantor<rsq/>s results can be hard to accept, even after you
          have seen the proofs and verified their validity.

      <p>
        To begin, let<rsq/>s suppress the underlying function and suppose we
        have
        <me>
          \sum_{n=0}^\infty(a_n\cos n\pi x\,+b_n\sin n\pi x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty(a^\prime_n\cos n\pi x\,+b^\prime_n\sin n\pi x)
          </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We ask: If these two series are equal must it be true that
        <m>a_n=a^\prime_n</m> and <m>b_n=b^\prime_n</m>? 
        We can
        reformulate this uniqueness question as follows: 
        Suppose
        <me>
          \displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left((a_n-a^\prime_n)\cos n\pi x\,+(b_n-b^\prime_n)\sin n\pi x\right) = 0
          </me>.
          If we let <m>c_n = a_n-a^\prime_n</m> and <m>d_n =
          b_n-b^\prime_n</m>, then the question becomes:     
          If
          <me>\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(c_n\cos n\pi x\,+d_n\sin n\pi x\right)
      = 0</me>, is it necessarily true that <m>c_n=d_n=0</m>?         </p>

      <p>
        Intuitively, it certainly seems reasonable to suppose so, but at
        this point we have enough experience with infinite sums to know
        that we need to be <em>very</em> careful about relying on the
        intuition we have gained from finite sums.

        <!-- The converse of the question above: If <m>c_n=d_n=0</m>, is it -->
        <!-- necessarily true that <me>\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(c_n\cos n\pi -->
        <!-- x\,+d_n\sin n\pi x\right) = 0</me>, is even more interesting, as -->
        <!-- we will soon see.  The answer to this seemingly basic question -->
        <!-- leads to some very profound results. -->
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Answering this question led Cantor to study the
        makeup of the real number system.  This in turn opened the door
        to the modern view of mathematics of the twentieth century.  In
        particular, Cantor proved the following result in 1871<nbsp
        />(<xref ref="jahnke03__histor_analy"/>, p. 305).

      <p>
        In his attempts to nail down precisely which <q>certain
        values</q> could be exceptional, Cantor was led to examine the
        nature of subsets of real numbers and ultimately to give a
        precise definition of the concept of infinite sets and to define
        an arithmetic of <q>infinite numbers.</q>

          Actually, he called them <term>transfinite numbers</term>
        because, by definition, numbers are finite.</p>

      <p>
        In  identifying those <q>certain
        values,</q> Cantor proved the following theorems, which we
        will state but not prove.

            then all of its coefficients vanish.

        </statement>
      </theorem>


      <p>
        Observe that this is not a trivial generalization.  Although the
        exceptional points are constrained to be finite in number, this
        number could still be extraordinarily large.  That is, even if
        the series given above differed from zero on
        <m>10^{\left(10^{100000}\right)}</m> distinct points in the
        interval <m>\left(0, 10^{-\left(10^{100000}\right)}\right)</m>
        the coefficients still vanish.  This remains true even if at
        each of these <m>10^{\left(10^{100000}\right)}</m> points the
        series converges to <m>10^{\left(10^{100000}\right)}</m>.  This
        is truly remarkable when you think of it this way.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point Cantor became more interested in these exceptional
        points than in the Fourier series problem that he<rsq/>d started
        with.  The next task he set for himself was to see just how
        general the set of exceptional points could be.  Following
        Cantor<rsq/>s lead we make the following definitions.

        The notion of the derived set forms the foundation of Cantor<rsq/>s
        exceptional set of values.  Specifically, let <m>S</m> again be
        a set of real numbers and consider the following sequence of
        sets:
        <me>
          S^{\,\prime}\supseteq \left(S^\prime\right)^\prime\supseteq \left(\left(S^\prime\right)^\prime\right)^\prime\supseteq \cdots

        Cantor showed that if, at some point, one of these derived sets
        is empty, then the uniqueness property still holds.
        Specifically, we have:

      Cantor<rsq/>s work led an re<ndash/>examination of the
      foundations of mathematics, one where mathematical ideas were
      recast in the language of sets. Nowadays we do this naturally,
      so it doesn<rsq/>t seem profound, but recasting mathematics in terms of <term>Set Theory</term> has fundamentally shaped our modern
      approach.  We<rsq/>ve already seen this in <xref
      ref="def_accumulation-point"></xref>, <xref
      ref="PROBLEMAccumulationPoint"></xref>, and <xref
      ref="def_derived-set"></xref> where we recast Cantor<rsq/>s
      definition of a limit point into set theoretic terms.
    </p> 

    <p>
      It turns out that we can also rewrite concepts such as limits
      and continuity in terms of sets.  This led to a subject known as
      point set topology.  We will not present all of the ideas from
      topology as this would require an entire new course with an
      entire new book.  But we can give you a look into how analysis
      concepts are recast in this set theoretic manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a set of real numbers <m>S</m> is called closed
      if it contains all of its limit points.  In other words,
      <m>S</m> is closed if and only if <m>S'\subset S.</m> If
      this sounds the same as our notion of a closed interval
      <m>[a,b]</m>, it is meant to since the idea is to recast
      familiar notions in terms of sets.  In fact, this closed
      interval contains all of its limit points, so it really is
      closed.  To see this, we will show that any point not in
      <m>S=[a,b]</m> is not a limit point of <m>S</m>.  First,
      suppose <m>c\notin [a,b]</m>.  If <m>c\lt a</m>, then if we
      let <m>\eps =a-c\gt0</m>, then <me>\left(c-\eps
      ,c+\eps \right)\cap
      \left[a,b\right]-\left\{c\right\}=\emptyset </me> so
      <m>c\notin S^\prime</m>.
    </p>
    <problem>
      <p>
        Prove that if <m>b\lt c</m>, then <m>c</m> is not a limit
        point of <m>[a,b]</m>.  This will complete the proof that
        <m>[a,b]</m> is closed.
      </p>
    </problem>
    <p>
      It is true that the term closed was modeled after closed
      intervals, but these are not the only closed sets.  Each of
      the following are closed sets.

        Again, we could spend an entire course delving into these concepts
        and more, but for our introduction we will show how the concept of
        continuity on a set can be repackaged into a statement involving
        sets.  To transition into talking about functions and sets, we
        have the following two definitions.  So we don't have to get into
        issues dealing with endpoints on intervals, etc., we will restrict
        ourselves to talking about functions <m>f(x)</m> whose domain is
        an open set <m>D</m> of real numbers.
      </p>
      <definition xml:id="DEFINITIONOpenByPreImage">

        With these definitions we have the following result

        Notice that in the previous problem, <m>f\left(U\right)\subset
        V</m> can be written as <m>U\subset f^{-1}(V)</m>.  Based

          Show that <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>D</m> if and only if

        </p>
      </problem>


      <p>
        The value of this reformulation of continuity, and similar
        definitions for limits in terms of open sets is that it can be
        generalized beyond the realm of real numbers to sets where the
        distance between points is either irrelevant or not even possible
        to determine.  With this in mind, in 1914, Felix Hausdorff
        (1868<ndash/>1942) defined what it means for a general set to have a
        topology based solely on sets and not relying on formulating a
        distance between its elements. Given an arbitrary nonempty set
        <m>S</m>, we define a topology on <m>S</m> to be a collection
        <m>\tau </m> of subsets of <m>S</m> which we designate to be
        <q>open</q> sets.  The modern rendition of Hausdorff's definition of
        a topology says that <m>\tau </m> must satisfy the following
        axioms.
      </p>
      <p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>S</m> and <m>\emptyset </m> must be in <m>\tau </m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              An arbitrary union of open sets in <m>\tau </m> must also be in <m>\tau </m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The intersection of any finite number of open sets in <m>\tau </m> must also be in <m>\tau </m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

      </p>


      <p>
        Hausdorff actually added an extra ``separation'' axiom.
      </p>
      <p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              For any two elements <m>x,y</m> of <m>S</m>, there must exist two disjoint open sets <m>U_x</m> and <m>U_y</m> with <m>x\in U_x</m> and <m>y\in U_y</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays, a topological space (that is a set with a topology
        defined on it) which has this extra property is called a
        Hausdorff space.
      </p>
      <p>
        This relatively simple idea generalizes our notion of open
        sets of real numbers and can be applied to a wide range of
        sets. We won't get into this, but we note that if we have a
        function <m>f:S\to T</m> from one topological space into
        another, we can define concepts like continuity by insisting
        that the preimage of any open set in the topology on <m>T</m>
        must be open in the topology on <m>S</m>.  It would be hard to
        overstate the impact of this on modern mathematics.

      Cantor<rsq/>s work with sets of real numbers prompted him to
      study the sizes of various infinite sets in general.  The
      following theorem follows directly from our previous work with
      the <xref ref="NIP" text="custom">NIP</xref>  and will be very handy later.  It basically says that a

      Our next theorem says that in a certain, very technical sense
      there are more real numbers than there are counting numbers
      <xref ref="franks10__cantor_other_proof_rr_uncoun" />. This
      probably does not seem terribly significant.  After all, there
      are real numbers which are not counting numbers.  What will make
      this so startling is that the same cannot be said about all sets

            To streamline things, we are abusing notation here as we

            ordered) and the underlying (unordered) set of entries in
            the sequence.
          </p>  
        </aside>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <proof>
      <p>
        For the sake of obtaining a contradiction assume that the
        sequence <m>S</m> contains every real number; that is,
        <m>S=\RR</m>.  As usual we will build a sequence of nested
        intervals <m>\left(\left[x_i,
        y_i\right]\right)_{i=1}^\infty</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let <m>x_1</m> be the smaller of the first two distinct
        elements of <m>S</m>, let <m>y_1</m> be the larger and take
        <m>\left[x_1,y_1\right]</m> to be the first interval.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next we assume that <m>\left[x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right]</m> has
        been constructed and build <m>\left[x_n, y_n\right]</m> as
        follows.  Observe that there are infinitely many elements of
        <m>S</m> in <m>\left(x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right)</m> since
        <m>S=\RR</m>.  Let <m>s_m</m> and <m>s_k</m> be the
        <em>first</em> two distinct elements of <m>S</m> such that
        <me> s_m, s_k \in \left(x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right) </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Take <m>x_n</m> to be the smaller and <m>y_n</m> to be the
        larger of <m>s_m</m> and <m>s_k</m>.  Then <m>\left[x_n,
        y_n\right]</m> is the <m>n</m>th interval.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the way we constructed them it is clear that <me>
        \left[x_1, y_1\right] \supseteq \left[x_2, y_2\right]
        \supseteq \left[x_3, y_3\right] \supseteq \ldots </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore by <xref ref="thm_WeakNIP"></xref> there is a
        real number, say <m>c</m>, such that <me> c\in\left[x_n,
        y_n\right] \text{ for all } n\in\NN </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, since <m>x_1\lt x_2\lt x_3\ldots\lt y_3\lt y_2\lt
        y_1</m> it is clear that
        <men xml:id="eq_NIP-interval">
          x_n\lt c\lt y_n, \ \forall n
          </men>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will show that <m>c</m> is the number we seek.  That the
        inequalities in <xref ref="eq_NIP-interval">formula</xref> are
        strict will play a crucial role.
      </p>

      <p>
        To see that <m>c\not\in S</m> we suppose that <m>c\in S</m>
        and derive a contradiction.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, suppose that <m>c=s_p</m> for some <m>p\in\NN</m>.  Then
        only <m>\left\{s_1, s_2,\ldots, s_{p-1}\right\}</m> appear
        before <m>s_p</m> in the sequence <m>S</m>.  Since each
        <m>x_n</m> is taken from <m>S</m> it follows that only
        finitely many elements of the sequence <m>(x_n)</m> appear
        before <m>s_p=c</m> in the sequence as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let <m>x_l</m> be the <em>last</em> element of <m>(x_n)</m>
        which appears before <m>c=s_p</m> in the sequence and consider
        <m>x_{l+1}</m>.  The way it was constructed, <m>x_{l+1}</m>
        was one of the first two distinct terms in the sequence
        <m>S</m> strictly between <m>x_l</m> and <m>y_l</m>, the other
        being <m>y_{l+1}</m>.  Since <m>x_{l+1}</m> does not appear
        before <m>c=s_p</m> in the sequence and <m>x_l\lt c\lt
        y_l</m>, it follows that either <m>c=x_{l+1}</m> or
        <m>c=y_{l+1}</m>.  However, this gives us a contradiction as
        we know from <xref ref="eq_NIP-interval">formula</xref> that
        <m>x_{l+1}\lt c\lt y_{l+1}</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus <m>c</m> is not an element of <m>S</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>

    <p>
      So how does this theorem show that there are <q>more</q> real
      numbers than counting numbers?  Before we address that question
      we need to be very careful about the meaning of the word <q>more</q>
      when we<rsq/>re talking about infinite sets.
    </p>

    <p>
      First let<rsq/>s consider two finite sets, say
      <m>A=\left\{\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\right\}</m> and
      <m>B=\left\{a,b,c,d,e\right\}</m>.  How do we know that <m>B</m>
      is the bigger set? (It obviously is.) Clearly we can just count
      the number of elements in both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.  Since
      <m>\abs{A}=4</m> and <m>\abs{B}=5</m> and <m>4\lt 5</m> <m>B</m>
      is clearly bigger.  But we<rsq/>re looking for a way to determine the
      relative size of two sets without counting them because we have
      no way of counting the number of elements of an infinite set.
      Indeed, it isn<rsq/>t even clear what the phrase <q>the number of
      elements</q> might <em>mean</em> when applied to the elements of
      an infinite set.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we count the number of elements in a finite set what we<rsq/>re
      really doing is matching up the elements of the set with a set
      of consecutive positive integers, starting at <m>1</m>.  Thus
      since
      <md>
        <mrow>1\amp \leftrightarrow\alpha</mrow>
        <mrow>2\amp \leftrightarrow\beta</mrow>
        <mrow>3\amp \leftrightarrow\gamma</mrow>
        <mrow>4\amp \leftrightarrow\delta</mrow>
      </md>
      we see that <m>\abs{A}=4</m>.  Moreover, the order of the
      match<ndash/>up is unimportant.  Thus since
      <md>
        <mrow>2\amp \leftrightarrow e</mrow>
        <mrow>3\amp \leftrightarrow a</mrow>
        <mrow>5\amp \leftrightarrow b</mrow>
        <mrow>4\amp \leftrightarrow d</mrow>
        <mrow>1\amp \leftrightarrow c</mrow>
      </md>
      it is clear that the elements of <m>B</m> and the set
      <m>\left\{1,2,3,4,5\right\}</m> can be matched up as well.  And
      it doesn<rsq/>t matter what order either set is in.  They both have
      <m>5</m> elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      <idx><h>cardinality</h><h>definition</h></idx>
      Such a match<ndash/>up is called a one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one
      correspondence.  In general, if two sets can be put in
      one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence then they are the same
      <q>size.</q> Of course the word <q>size</q> has lots of
      connotations that will begin to get in the way when we talk
      about infinite sets, so instead we will say that the two sets
      have the same <term>cardinality</term>. Speaking loosely, this just
      means that they are the same size.
    </p>

    <p> 
      More precisely, if a given set <m>S</m> can be put in
      one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence with a finite set of
      consecutive integers beginning at <m>1</m>, say
      <m>\left\{1,2,3,\ldots, N\right\}</m>, then we say that the
      cardinality of the set is <m>N</m>.  But again, the precise statement is  that
      both sets have the same cardinality.  It is this notion of
      one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence, along with the next two
      definitions, which will allow us to compare the sizes
      (cardinalities) of infinite sets.

        <p>
          Any set which can be put into one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence with
          <m>\NN=\left\{1,2,3,\ldots\right\}</m> is called a
          <term>countably infinite</term> set.  Any set which is
          either finite or countably infinite is said to be

    <p>
      <idx><h>Cantor, Georg</h></idx>

      Since <m>\NN</m> is an infinite set, we have no symbol to
      designate its cardinality so we have to invent one.  The symbol
      used by Cantor and adopted by mathematicians ever since is
      <m>\aleph_0</m>.  Thus the cardinality of any countably infinite
      set is <m>\aleph_0</m>.
    </p>

        <m>\aleph{}</m> is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet and

      We have already given the following definition informally.  We

          If two sets can be put into one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence then

        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      <idx><h>infinite sets</h><h>uncountable</h></idx>
      With these two definitions in place we can see that <xref
      ref="thm_NoSeriesContainsAllReals"></xref> is nothing more nor
      less than the statement that <m>\RR{}</m> is not countably
      infinite since it is certainly not finite and the subscripts
      identify a one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one correspondence. In that case
      we say that the set of real numbers is <term>uncountably
      infinite</term> or just <term>uncountable</term>. Speaking
      loosely we say that <m>\RR </m> is <q>bigger</q> than the
      natural numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      To see this let us suppose first that each real number appears
      in the sequence <m>(s_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> exactly once.  In that
      case the indexing of our sequence is really just a one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one
      correspondence between the elements of the sequence and
      <m>\NN:</m>
      <md>
        <mrow>1\amp \leftrightarrow s_1</mrow>
        <mrow>2\amp \leftrightarrow s_2</mrow>

        <mrow>4\amp \leftrightarrow s_4</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \ \ \ \vdots</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      If some real numbers are repeated in our sequence then all of
      the real numbers are a subset of our sequence and will therefore
      also be countable by part (a) of  <xref
      ref="prob_countable_sets_unions_of"></xref>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In either case, every sequence is countable.  But <xref ref="thm_NoSeriesContainsAllReals" ></xref> 
      says that <em>no</em> sequence in <m>\RR</m> includes all of
      <m>\RR</m>.  Therefore <m>\RR</m> is uncountable.

      All of our efforts to build an uncountable set from a countable
      one have come to nothing.  In fact many sets that at first

      the uncountability of <m>\RR</m> all the more remarkable.

        is not Riemann (Cauchy, or Darboux) integrable . Dirichlet
        invented this function simply as an example of a
        non<ndash/>integrable function. In itself it has no importance
        beyond that. However the existence of non<ndash/>integrable
        functions suggests the question, can the integral be defined in
        such a way as to capture all of the intuitive features known to
        17th century mathematician and which allows us to integrate
        something as bizarre seeming as the Dirichlet Function?

  <p>
    Of particular note is the work of Thomas Jan Stieltjes. While
    working on the problem of determining the mass distribution of an
    object given that the moments of all orders of a body are given
    (called the moment problem) he defined a slight generalization of
    the Riemann integral which was published in his work
    <foreign>Recherches sur les fractions continues</foreign>
    (Research on Continued Fractions) in 1894.  
    <!-- If you are acquainted -->
    <!-- with probability theory, the first moment of a probability density -->
    <!-- function is the expected value, the second moment (about the mean) -->
    <!-- is the variance, etc.  The problem is to reconstruct the -->
    <!-- probability density function from these moments.   -->
  </p>
  <p>
    As intimidating
    as the problem sounds, you are acquainted with the idea of a
    Stieltjes integral, but not by this name.  Consider for example,
    <me>\int^1_{x=0}{\sin\left(x^2\right)2x\dx{x}}</me>.


    In trying to compute this integral, you can quickly recognize that this is the integral
    
    <me>\int^1_{x=0}{\sin(x^2)} \dx(x^2)</me> We are writing the
    integral this way to emphasize the differential <m>\dx{(x^2)}</m>.
    In the Riemann integral <me>\int^1_{u=0}{{\mathrm{sin}
    \left(u\right)\ }\ du}</me> the differential <m>\dx{u}</m>
    represents the fact that the interval is being partitioned into
    subintervals whose lengths are being measured.  The differential
    <m>d\left(x^2\right)=2xdx</m> represents the idea that points
    closer to one carry more weight or are denser than those closer
    to zero: 

    <md>
      <mrow>
        \mineval{2x\dx{x}}{x=0}\amp{}=0\dx{x}
        <!-- \left.2x\dx{x}\right|_{x=0}\amp{}=0\dx{x} -->
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
\mineval{2x\dx{x}}{x=\frac12} \amp{}=1 \dx{x}
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
      \mineval{2x\dx{x}}{x=1}\amp{}=2 \dx{x}.
      </mrow>
    </md>
    This says that the <q>lengths</q> of the subintervals in our
    partition are being measured in different ways.  In general,
    given two functions <m>f\left(x\right),\ g(x)</m>, the Stieltjes
    integral is defined by <me>\int^b_{x=a}{f\left(x\right)dg}</me>
  </p>
      <p>
        You can see that the Riemann integral is just the Stieltjes
        integral with <m>g\left(x\right)=x</m>.  We won't go further
        with the Stieltjes integral except to say that it is useful in
        probability and physics in places where <m>f</m> has jumps.
        With the proper density function, these discontinuities can be
        minimized.  It is also generalizable to functional analysis.
        It also sets the stage for what we will focus on, which is to
        find a way to integrate a function such as the Dirichlet
        function.  The trick is to not focus on the function but on
        the interval on which it is integrated and how to measure the
        subsets in a partition.  This generalization comes from

      <p>
        Given Cantor's results that the set of rational numbers is
        countable while the set of irrational numbers is uncountable,
        Lebesgue thought that the value of <m>f\left(x\right)</m> on a
        relatively ``small'' set such as the rational numbers should
        have no bearing on the value of an integral and he focused
        more on measuring the ``sizes'' of sets to take that into
        account.  The basis of this idea comes from the following.
      </p>

      <theorem xml:id="THEOREMMeasureZero">

        <statement>

          <p>
            Let <m>S=\{s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots \}</m> be countably
            infinite set of real numbers.  Let <m>\eps >0</m>.  There
            is a collection of open intervals <m>(a_n,\ b_n)</m> with
            <me>S\subset \bigcup^{\infty }_{n=1}{\left(a_n,\
            b_n\right)}</me> and <me>\sum^{\infty
            }_{n=1}{\left(b_n-a_n\right)}=\eps </me>

          </p>

    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <problem>

    <statement>

      <p>
        Prove Theorem <xref ref="THEOREMMeasureZero"></xref>. 
      </p>

    </statement>      

    <hint>
      <p>
        Consider the interval <m>\left(s_n-\frac{\eps  }{2^{n+1}},\ s_n+\frac{\eps }{2^{n+1}}\right)</m>.]
      </p>
    </hint>



  </problem>   

  <p>
    The collection of intervals <m>(a_n,b_n)</m> with <m>S\subset
    \bigcup^{\infty }_{n=1}{\left(a_n,\ b_n\right)}</m> is called
    an open cover of <m>S</m>.  Lebesgue defined the (outer)
    measure of a set to be the infimum of the sums <m>\sum^{\infty
    }_{n=1}{\left(b_n-a_n\right)}</m> over all such open covers.
    In symbols, the (outer) measure of a set <m>S</m>
    <m>\left(\lambda \left(S\right)\right)</m> is given by
    
    <me>\lambda(S)=\inf_{S\subset \bigcup^{\infty}_{n=1}{(a_n,\ b_n)}} \left(\sum^{\infty }_{n=1}{\left(b_n-a_n\right)}\right) </me> 


  </p>

  <p>
    Given the result of <xref ref="THEOREMMeasureZero"></xref>,
    any countable set would have Lebesgue measure zero.  Since the
    rational numbers are countably infinite, then they have
    measure zero.  We won't get into the details of a Lebesgue
    integral, but it should not be surprising that if two
    (Lebesgue integrable) functions, <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>, differ
    from each other on set of measure zero, then they should have
    the same value for their Lebesgue integrals.  Since the
    Dirichlet function differs from the constantly one function on
    a set of measure zero (namely <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>), then it
    should be Lebesgue integrable (as a constant function should
    be) and its integral would be

    
    <me>\int^b_{x=a}{f\left(x\right)d\lambda =\left(b-a\right)}</me> 


  </p>



  <p>

    You may have noticed that we used the term outer measure before.
    For a measurable set, its measure is this outer measure.  However,
    there are examples of non<ndash/>measurable sets.  Any set would have an
    outer measure, but assigning this as the measure of one of these
    non<ndash/>measurable sets results in a number of contradictions on how a
    measure should behave. 
  </p>


  <p>
    The first non<ndash/>measurable set was described
    by 
    Giuseppe Vitali  in 1905.  Creating such a set
    requires the use of something called the Axiom of Choice and delves
    deeply into a careful study of the theory of sets.  We will see how
    complicated sets can be in the next section.

   <title>Cantor<rsq/>s Theorem and Its Consequences</title>



   <p>
     After employing his ideas on infinite sets of real numbers to
     study trigonometric series, Cantor gravitated toward applying
     his ideas to sets in general.  For example, Once Cantor showed
     that there were two types of infinity (countable and
     uncountable), the following question was natural, <q>Do all
     uncountable sets have the same cardinality?</q>
   </p>

   <p>
     Just like not all <q>non<ndash/>dogs</q> are cats, there is, offhand,
     no reason to believe that all uncountable sets should be the
     same size.  However constructing uncountable sets of different
     sizes is not as easy as it sounds.

     <idx>
       <h>Cantor, Georg</h>
       <h>unit interval and unit square have equal cardinalty</h>
     </idx>
     
     For example, what about the line segment represented by the
     interval <m>[0,1]</m> and the square represented by the set
     <m>[0,1]\times[0,1]=\left\{(x,y)|0\leq x,y\leq 1\right\}</m>.
     Certainly the two dimensional square must be a larger infinite
     set than the one dimensional line segment.  Remarkably, Cantor
     showed that these two sets were the same cardinality.  In his
     1877 correspondence of this result to his friend and fellow
     mathematician, <url

     visual="mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Dedekind/">Richard

   <p>
     The following gives the original idea of Cantor<rsq/>s proof.  Cantor
     devised the following function <m>f:[0,1]\times[0,1]\rightarrow
     [0,1]</m>.  First, we represent the coordinates of any point
     <m>(x,y)\in [0,1]\times[0,1]</m> by their decimal
     representations <m>x=0.a_1 a_2 a_3\ldots</m> and <m>y=0.b_1 b_2
     b_3\ldots</m>.  Even terminating decimals can be written this
     way as we could write <m>0.5=0.5000\ldots</m>.  We can then
     define <m>f(x,y)</m> by <me> f((0.a_1 a_2 a_3\ldots ,0.b_1 b_2
     b_3\ldots))=0.a_1 b_1 a_2 b_2 a_3 b_3\ldots </me>.
   </p>

   <p>
     This relatively simple idea has some technical difficulties in
     it related to the following result.
   </p>

   <problem>
     <idx><h>series</h><h>Geometric series</h><h>
     <m>(0.\bar{9})</m> converges to <m>1</m></h></idx> 
     <statement>
       <p>
         Consider the sequence <m>(0.9,0.99,0.999,\ldots)</m>.
         Determine that this sequence converges and, in fact, it
         converges to <m>1</m>.  This suggests that
         <m>0.999\ldots=1</m>.
       </p>
     </statement>
   </problem>

   <p>
     Similarly, we have <m>0.04999\ldots=0.05000\ldots</m>, etc.  To
     make the decimal representation of a real number in <m>[0,1]</m>
     unique, we must make a consistent choice of writing a
     terminating decimal as one that ends in an infinite string of
     zeros or an infinite string of nines [with the one exception
     <m>0=0.000\ldots</m> ]. No matter which choice we make, we could
     never make this function onto.  For example,
     <m>109/1100=0.09909090\ldots</m> would have as its pre-image
     <m>(0.0999\ldots,0.9000\ldots)</m> which would be a mix of the
     two conventions.
   </p>

   <p>
     Cantor was able to overcome this technicality to demonstrate a
     one to one correspondence, but instead we will note that in
     either convention, the function is one<ndash/>to<ndash/>one, so this says that
     the set <m>[0,1]\times[0,1]</m> is the same cardinality as some
     (uncountable) subset of <m>\RR</m>.  The fact that this has the
     same cardinality as <m>\RR</m> is something we will come back
     to.  But first we<rsq/>ll try construct an uncountable set which does
     not have the same cardinality as <m>\RR</m>.  To address this
     issue, Cantor proved the following in 1891.

   <p>
     Actually it turns out that <m>\RR</m> and <m>P(\NN)</m> have the
     same cardinality.  This can be seen in a roundabout way using
     some of the above ideas from <xref
     ref="prob_PowerSet"></xref>.  Specifically, let <m>T</m>
     be the set of all sequences of zeros or ones (you can use
     <m>Y</m>s or <m>N</m>s, if you prefer).  Then it is
     straightforward to see that <m>T</m> and <m>P(\NN)</m> have the
     same cardinality.
   </p>

   <p>
     If we consider <m>(0,1]</m>, which has the same cardinality as
     <m>\RR</m>, then we can see that this has the same cardinality
     as <m>T</m> as well.  Specifically, if we think of the numbers
     in binary, then every real number in <m>[0,1]</m> can be written
     as <m>\sum_{j=1}^\infty \frac{a_j}{2^j} =0.a_1a_2a_3\ldots</m>
     where <m>a_j\in\left\{0,1\right\}</m>.  We have to account for
     the fact that binary representations such as <m>0.0111\ldots</m>
     and <m>0.1000\ldots</m> represent the same real number (say that
     no representations will end in an infinite string of zeros),
     then we can see that <m>[0,1]</m> has the same cardinality as
     <m>T-U</m>, where <m>U</m> is the set of all sequences ending in
     an infinite string of zeros.  It turns out that <m>U</m> itself
     is a countable set.

     As we indicated before, Cantor<rsq/>s <idx><h>Cantor,
     Georg</h></idx> work on infinite sets had a profound impact on
     mathematics in the beginning of the twentieth century.  For
     example, in examining the proof of Cantor<rsq/>s Theorem, the
     eminent logician 
     <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Russell/" visual="mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Russell/">Bertrand Russell</url> (1872<ndash/>1970) devised his famous paradox in
     1901.

     Through the work of Cantor and others, sets were becoming a
     central object of study in mathematics as many mathematical
     concepts were being reformulated in terms of sets, as we saw in
     <xref ref="SECTIONRiseSetTheory" ></xref>.  The idea was that set
     theory was to be a unifying theme of mathematics but
     Russell<rsq/>s paradox set the mathematical world on its ear
     because it showed that the  naive understanding of a 
     as just a collection of objects leads to logical difficulties.
   </p>

   <fact>
     <!-- <title>Russell<rsq/>s Paradox</title> -->
     <idx><h>Russell<rsq/>s Paradox</h></idx>
     <p>
       Consider the set of all sets
       which are not elements of themselves.  We call this set <m>D</m>
       and ask, <q>Is <m>D\in D?</m></q> Symbolically, this set is <me>
       D=\{S\ |\ S\not \in S\} </me>.
     </p>

     <p>
       If <m>D\in D</m>, then by definition, <m>D\not\in D</m>.  If
       <m>D\not\in D</m>, then by definition, <m>D\in D</m>.
     </p>
   </fact>

  <p>
    If you look back at the proof of Cantor<rsq/>s Theorem, this was
    basically the idea that gave us the contradiction.  To have such
    a contradiction occurring at the most basic level of mathematics
    was scandalous.  It forced a number of mathematicians and
    logicians to carefully devise the axioms by which sets could be
    constructed.  To be honest, most mathematicians still approach
    set theory from a naive point of view as the sets we typically
    deal with fall under the category of what we would call
    <q>normal sets.</q> In fact, such an approach is officially
    called Naive Set Theory (as opposed to 
    <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Beginnings_of_set_theory/" visual="mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Beginnings_of_set_theory/">Axiomatic Set Theory</url>).
    However, attempts to put set theory and logic on solid footing
    led to the modern study of symbolic logic and ultimately the
    design of computer (machine) logic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another place where Cantor<rsq/>s work had a profound influence in
    modern logic comes from something we alluded to before.  We
    showed before that the unit square <m>[0,1]\times [0,1]</m> had
    the same cardinality as an uncountable subset of <m>\RR</m>.  In
    fact, Cantor <idx><h>Cantor, Georg</h></idx> showed that the
    unit square had the same cardinality as <m>\RR</m> itself and
    was moved to advance the following in 1878.
  </p>

  <conjecture>
    <title>The Continuum Hypothesis</title>
    <idx><h>Continuum Hypothesis</h><h>original</h></idx> 
    <statement>

      <p>
        Every uncountable subset of <m>\RR</m> has the same
        cardinality as <m>\RR</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </conjecture>

  <p>
    Cantor was unable to prove or disprove this conjecture (along with
    every other mathematician). In fact, proving or disproving the
    Continuum Hypothesis, was one of <url
    href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hilbert/"
    visual="mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hilbert/">David
    Hilbert<rsq/>s</url> famous <url
    href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Hilbert_Problems/"
    visual="mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Hilbert_Problems/">23
    problems</url> which he presented as a challenge for the
    mathematics community at the International Congress of
    Mathematicians in 1900.

  <p>
    Since <m>\RR</m> has the same cardinality as <m>P(\NN)</m>, then
    the Continuum Hypothesis was generalized to the:
  </p>

  <conjecture>
    <title>The Generalized Continuum Hypothesis</title>
    <idx><h>Continuum Hypothesis</h><h>generalized</h></idx>
    <statement>

      <p>
        Given an infinite set <m>S</m>, there is no infinite set
        which has a cardinality strictly between that of <m>S</m>
        and its power set <m>P(S)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </conjecture>

  <p>
    Efforts to prove or disprove this were in vain and with good
    reason.  In 1940, the logician         <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Godel/"  visual="mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Godel/">Kurt Gödel</url> showed that the
    Continuum Hypothesis could not be disproved from the
    
    <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory" visual="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory">Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms</url> of set theory.  In 1963, 
    <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Cohen/" visual="mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Cohen/">Paul Cohen</url> (1934<ndash/>2007)
    showed that the Continuum Hypothesis could not be proved using
    the Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms.  In other words, the
    Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms do not contain enough information to
    decide the truth of the hypothesis.

  <p>
    We are willing to bet that at this point your head might be
    swimming a bit with uncertainty.  If so, then know that these
    are the same feelings that the mathematical community
    experienced in the mid twentieth century.  In the past,
    mathematics was seen as a model of logical certainty.  It is
    disconcerting to find that there are statements that are
    <q>undecidable.</q> In fact, G&#xf6;del proved in 1931 that a
    consistent finite axiom system that contained the axioms of
    arithmetic would always contain undecidable statements which
    could neither be proved true nor false with those axioms.
    Mathematical knowledge would always be incomplete.
  </p>



  <p>
    So by trying to put the foundations of Calculus on solid ground,
    we have come to a point where we can never obtain mathematical
    certainty.  Does this mean that we should throw up our hands and
    concede defeat?  Should we be paralyzed with fear of trying
    anything?  Certainly not!  As we mentioned before, most
    mathematicians do well by taking a pragmatic approach: using
    their mathematics to solve problems that they encounter.  In
    fact, it is typically the problems that motivate the
    mathematics.  It is true that mathematicians take chances that
    don<rsq/>t always pan out, but they still take these chances, often
    with success.  Even when the successes lead to more questions,
    as they typically do, tackling those questions usually leads to
    a deeper understanding.  At the very least, our incomplete
    understanding means we will always have more questions to
    answer, more problems to solve.
