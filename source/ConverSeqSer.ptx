      In <xref ref="CalcIn17th18thCentury"></xref>, we
      developed the equation <m>1+x+x^2+x^3+\cdots=\frac{1}{1-x}</m>,
      and we mentioned that there are  limitations to this power series
      representation.  For example, substituting <m>x=1</m> and
      <m>x=-1</m> into this expression leads to

      <md>
      
        <mrow>
          1+1+1+\cdots=\frac{1}{0}\amp{}\amp{} \text{and}\amp{}\amp{}  1-1+1-1+\cdots=\frac{1}{2}
        </mrow>

      </md>

      which are rather hard to accept.  On the other hand, if we
      substitute <m>x=\frac{1}{2}</m> into the expression we get
      <men xml:id="EQUATIONSeqVsSer">
        1+\frac{1}{2}+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3+\cdots=2
      </men>
      which seems more palatable. Until we think about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can add two numbers together by the method we all learned in
      elementary school.  Or three numbers.  Or any finite set of
      numbers. At least in principle.  But infinitely many?  What does
      that even mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we can add infinitely many numbers together we must find
      a way to give meaning to the idea of adding infinitely many
      numbers.

      To do this, we examine an infinite sum by thinking of it as a
      <term>sequence</term> of finite <term>partial sums</term>.

      <p>
        We assume that you are familiar with the distinction between a
        sequence and a series from your Calculus course. However, for
        the sake of clarity we<rsq/>ll make this explicit here. A
        <term>sequence</term> numbers is simply a
        comma<ndash/>separated list of numbers. A single number from a
        sequence is an <term>element</term> of the sequence.  A
        <term>series</term> is the sum of the elements of a
        <term>sequence</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For  example, 
        <me>
          \left(1,\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8},\cdots \right) =
          \left(\frac{1}{2^n}\right)_{n=0}^\infty
        </me>
        is a Geometric <term>Sequence</term>, whereas 
        <me>
          1+\frac{1}{2}+ \frac{1}{4}+ \frac{1}{8} + \cdots{}) =
          \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n}
        </me>
        is a Geometric <term>Series</term>.

      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      From <xref ref="EQUATIONSeqVsSer" >equation</xref> we would have
      the following <term>sequence</term> of <term>partial
      sums</term>.
      <me>
        \left(1,1+\frac{1}{2},1+\frac{1}{2}+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2,1+
        \frac{1}{2}+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3,\ldots,\sum_{j=0}^n\left(\frac{1}{2}
        \right)^j,\ldots\right) </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can plot these sums on a number line to see what they tend toward as <m>n</m> gets large.
    </p>

    <!-- <sidebyside width="90%" margins="auto" valign="middle"> -->

    </image>
    <!-- </sidebyside> -->


    <p>
      Since each partial sum is located at the midpoint between the
      previous partial sum and <m>2</m>, it is reasonable to suppose
      that these sums tend to the number 2.  Indeed, you have probably
      seen an expression such as
      <me>\limit{n}{\infty}{\left(\sum_{j=0}^n\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^j\right)}=2</me>
      justified by a similar argument.  Of course, relying on pictures
      is fine if we are satisfied with intuition.  However, to
      establish rigor we cannot rely on pictures or such nebulous
      words as <q>approaches.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      No doubt you are wondering <q>What<rsq/>s wrong with the word
      <sq>approaches</sq>?  It seems clear enough to me.</q> This is
      often a sticking point.  But if we think carefully about what we
      mean by the word <q>approach</q> we see that there is an
      implicit assumption that will cause us some difficulties later
      if we don<rsq/>t expose it.
    </p>

    <p>
      To see this consider the sequence
      <m>\left(1,\frac12,\frac13,\frac14,\ldots\right)</m>.  Clearly
      it <q>approaches</q> zero, right?  But, doesn<rsq/>t it also
      <q>approach</q> <m>-1?</m> It does, in the sense that each term
      gets closer to <m>-1</m> than the one previous.  But it also
      <q>approaches</q> <m>-2</m>, <m>-3</m>, or even <m>-1000</m> in
      the same sense.  That<rsq/>s the problem with the word
      <q>approaches.</q> It just says that at each step we<rsq/>re
      closer to something than we were in the previous step.  It does
      not tell us that we are actually getting close.  Since the moon
      moves in an elliptical orbit about the earth for part of each
      month it is <q>approaching</q> the earth.  The moon gets
      clos<em>er</em> to the earth but, thankfully, it does not get
      <em>close</em> to the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The implicit assumption we alluded to earlier is this: When we
      say that the sequence <m>\left(\frac1n\right)_{n=1}^\infty</m>
      <q>approaches</q> zero we mean that it is getting <em>close</em>
      not clos<em>er</em>.  Ordinarily this kind of vagueness in our
      language is pretty innocuous.  When we say <q>approaches</q> in
      casual conversation we can usually tell from the context of the
      conversation whether we mean <q>getting close to</q> or
      <q>getting closer to.</q> But when speaking mathematically we
      need to be more careful, more explicit, in the language we use.
    </p>


    <p>
      So how can we change the language we use so that this ambiguity
      is eliminated?  We start by recognizing, rigorously, what we
      mean when we say that a sequence converges to zero.  For
      example, you would probably want to say that the sequence
      <m>\left(1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{4},\,\ldots\right)=\left(
      \frac{1}{n}\right)_{n=1}^\infty</m> converges to zero.  Is there
      a way to give this meaning without relying on pictures or
      intuition?
    </p>

    <p>
      One way would be to say that we can make <m>\frac{1}{n}</m> as
      close to zero as we wish, provided we make <m>n</m> large
      enough.  But even this needs to be made more specific.  For
      example, we can get <m>\frac{1}{n}</m> to within a distance of
      <m>0.1</m> of <m>0</m> provided we make <m>n>10</m>, we can get
      <m>\frac{1}{n}</m> to within a distance of <m>0.01</m> of
      <m>0</m> provided we make <m>n>100</m>, etc.  After a few such
      examples it is apparent that given any arbitrary distance
      <m>\eps>0</m>, we can get <m>\frac{1}{n}</m> to within
      <m>\eps</m> of <m>0</m> provided we make
      <m>n>\frac{1}{\eps}</m>.  This leads to the following
      definition.

      <idx><h>sequences</h><h>convergence to zero</h></idx>
      <idx><h>Definition</h><h>convergence of a sequence to zero</h></idx>

      Let <m>\left(s_n\right)=\left(s_1,s_2,s_3,\ldots\right)</m> be a
      sequence of real numbers.  We say that
      <m>\left(\boldsymbol{s}_{\boldsymbol{n}}\right)</m>
      <term>converges to 0</term> and write
      <me>\limit{n}{\infty}{s_n}=0</me> provided for any
      <m>\eps>0</m>, there is a real number <m>N</m> such that if
      <m>n>N</m>, then <m>|s_n|\lt \eps</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>

<p>
  <term>Notes on <xref ref="def_ConvergeToZero"></xref></term>:

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        This definition is the formal version of the idea we just
        talked about. Given an arbitrary distance <m>\eps</m>, we
        must be able to find a specific number <m>N</m> such that
        <m>s_n</m> is within <m>\eps</m> of <m>0</m>, whenever
        <m>n>N</m>.  The <m>N</m> is the answer to the question,
        how large is <q>large enough</q> to put <m>s_n</m> this
        close to <m>0</m>.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Even though we didn<rsq/>t need it in the example
        <m>\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)</m>, the absolute value appears in
        the definition because we need to make the distance from
        <m>s_n</m> to 0 smaller than <m>\eps</m>.  Without the
        absolute value in the definition, we would be able to
        <q>prove</q> such outrageous statements as
        <m>\limitt{n}{\infty}{-n}=0</m>, which we obviously don<rsq/>t
        want.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        The statement <m>|s_n|\lt \eps</m> can also be written as
        <m>-\eps\lt s_n\lt \eps</m> or <m>s_n\in\left(-\eps,\eps\right)</m>.
        (See the <xref ref="prob_absolute_value"></xref> below.)
        Any one of these equivalent formulations can be used to prove convergence.
        Depending on the application,
        one of these may be more advantageous to use than the others.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Any time an <m>N</m> can be found that works for a particular <m>\eps</m>,
        any number <m>M>N</m> will work for that <m>\eps</m> as well,
        since if <m>n>M</m> then <m>n>N</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<problem xml:id="prob_absolute_value">
  <statement>
    <p>
      <idx><h>absolute value</h></idx>
      Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be real numbers with <m>b>0</m>.
      Prove <m>|a|\lt b</m> if and only if <m>-b\lt a\lt b</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that this can be extended to
      <m>\abs{a}\leq b</m> if and only if <m>-b\leq a\leq b</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</problem>

<p>
  To illustrate how <xref ref="def_ConvergeToZero"></xref> makes the above ideas rigorous,
  let<rsq/>s use it to prove that <m>\limit{n}{\infty}{\textstyle\frac{1}{n}}=0</m>.
</p>

<proof>
  <p>
    Let <m>\eps>0</m> be given.
    Let <m>N=\frac{1}{\eps}</m>.
    If <m>n>N</m>,
    then <m>n>\frac{1}{\eps}</m> and so <m>\abs{\frac{1}{n}}=\frac{1}{n}\lt \eps</m>.
    Hence by definition,
    <m>\limitt{n}{\infty}{\frac{1}{n}}=0</m>.
  </p>
</proof>

<p>
  Notice that this proof is rigorous and makes no reference to
  vague notions such as <q>getting smaller</q> or <q>approaching
  infinity.</q> It has three components:
  <ol>
    <li>
      provide the challenge of a distance <m>\eps>0</m>, 
    </li>
    <li>
      identify a real number <m>N</m>,
      and 
    </li>
    <li>
      show that this <m>N</m> works for this given <m>\eps</m>.
    </li>
  </ol>
  There is also no explanation about where <m>N</m> came from.
  While it is true that this choice of <m>N</m> is not surprising
  in light of the <q>scrapwork</q> we did before the definition,
  the motivation for how we got it is not in the formal proof nor
  is it required.  In fact, such scrapwork is typically not
  included in a formal proof.  For example, consider the
  following.
</p>

<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Use <xref ref="def_ConvergeToZero" ></xref> to prove that
      <me>
        \limit{n}{\infty}{\frac{\sin n}{n}}=0
        </me>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</example>
<proof>
  <p>
    Let <m>\eps>0</m>.
    Let <m>N=\frac{1}{\eps}</m>.
    If <m>n>N</m>,
    then <m>n>\frac{1}{\eps}</m> and <m>\frac{1}{n}\lt \eps</m>.
    Thus
    <m>\abs{\frac{\sin(n)}{n}}\leq\frac{1}{n}\lt \eps</m>.
    Hence by definition,
    <m>\limitt{n}{\infty}{\frac{\sin n}{n}}=0</m>.
  </p>
</proof>




<p>
  Notice that the <m>N</m> came out of nowhere,
  but you can probably see the thought process that went into this choice:
  We needed to use the inequality <m>\abs{\sin n}\leq 1</m>.
  Again this scrapwork is not part of the formal proof,
  but it is typically necessary for finding what <m>N</m> should be.
  You might be able to do the next problem without doing any scrapwork first,
  but don<rsq/>t hesitate to do scrapwork if you need it.

        </me>.

    <p>
      As the sequences get more complicated, doing scrapwork ahead of time
      becomes more necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>SCRAPWORK</term>
    </p>
    <p>
      Given an <m>\eps>0</m>,
      we need to see how large to make <m>n</m> in order to guarantee that <m>|\frac{n+4}{n^2+1}|\lt \eps</m>.
      First notice that <m>\frac{n+4}{n^2+1}\lt \frac{n+4}{n^2}</m>.
      Also, notice that if <m>n>4</m>,
      then <m>n+4\lt n+n=2n</m>.
      So as long as <m>n>4</m>,
      we have <m>\frac{n+4}{n^2+1}\lt \frac{n+4}{n^2}\lt \frac{2n}{n^2}=\frac{2}{n}</m>.
      We can make this less than <m>\eps</m> if we make <m>n>\frac{2}{\eps}</m>.
      This means we need to make <m>n>4</m> and <m>n>\frac{2}{\eps}</m>,
      simultaneously.
      These can be done if we let <m>N</m> be the maximum of these two numbers.
      This sort of thing comes up regularly,
      so the notation <m>N=\max\left(4,\frac{2}{\eps}\right)</m> was developed to mean the maximum of these two numbers.
      Notice that if <m>N=\max\left(4, \frac{2}{\eps}\right)</m> then <m>N\geq 4</m> and <m>N\geq\frac{2}{\eps}</m>.
      We<rsq/>re now ready for the formal proof.
    </p>
  </statement>
</example>
<proof>
  <p>
    Let <m>\eps>0</m>.
    Let <m>N=\max\left(4,\frac{2}{\eps}\right)</m>.
    If <m>n>N</m>, then <m>n>4</m> and <m>n>\frac{2}{\eps}</m>.
    Thus we have <m>n>4</m> and <m>\frac{2}{n}\lt \eps</m>.
    Therefore
    <me>
      \abs{\frac{n+4}{n^2+1}}=\frac{n+4}{n^2+1}\lt \frac{n+4}{n^2}\lt \frac{2n}{n^2}= \frac{2}{n}\lt \eps
      </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hence by definition,
    <m>\limit{n}{\infty}{\frac{n+4}{n^2+1}}=0</m>.
  </p>
</proof>

<p> 
  Again we emphasize that the scrapwork is not <alert>explicitly</alert> a
  part of the formal proof.  However,
  if you look carefully, you can always find the scrapwork in the formal
  proof.

<p>
  We can negate <xref ref="def_ConvergeToZero" ></xref> to prove that
  a particular sequence does not converge to zero.
  Before we look at an example, let<rsq/>s analyze what it means for a
  sequence <m>\left(s_n\right)</m> to not converge to zero.
</p>
<p>
  Converging to zero means that any time a distance <m>\eps>0</m> is
  given, we must be able to respond with a number <m>N</m> such that
  <m>|s_n|\lt \eps</m> for every <m>n>N</m>.  To have this not happen,
  we must be able to find some <m>\eps>0</m> such that no choice of
  <m>N</m> will work.  Of course, if we find such an <m>\eps</m>, then
  any smaller value will also fail to have such an <m>N</m>, but we
  only need one.

  <example xml:id="ex_zero-two-not-converge">
    <statement>

        Use the definition to prove that the sequence

      </p>

    </statement>

  <proof>
    <p>
      If you stare at the example long enough, you see that any
      <m>\eps</m> with <m>0\lt \eps\leq 2</m> will cause problems.
      For the sake of specificity (rigor) we will let <m>\eps=2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also let <m>N\in\NN</m> be any integer.
      If we let <m>k</m> be any non<ndash/>negative integer with <m>k>\frac{N}{2}</m>,
      then <m>n=2k>N</m>, but <m>|1+(-1)^n|=2</m>.
      Thus no choice of <m>N</m> will satisfy the conditions of the definition for this <m>\eps</m>, (namely that
      <m>|1+(-1)^n|\lt 2</m> for all <m>n>N</m>) and so <m>\limit{n}{\infty}{\left(1+(-1)^n\right)}\neq 0</m>.

    Now that we have a handle on how to rigorously prove that a sequence converges to zero,
    let<rsq/>s generalize this to a formal definition for a sequence converging to something else.
    Basically, we want to say that a sequence
    <m>\left(s_n\right)</m> converges to a real number <m>s</m>,
    provided the difference <m>\left(s_n-s\right)</m> converges to zero.
    This leads to the following definition:
  </p>

        Let <m>\left(s_n\right)=\left(s_1,s_2,s_3,\ldots\right)</m> be a sequence of real numbers and let <m>s</m> be a real number.
        We say that <m>\left(\boldsymbol{s}_{\boldsymbol{n}}\right)</m> converges to <m>\boldsymbol{s}</m> and write
        <m>\limitt{n}{\infty}{s_n}=s</m> provided for any <m>\eps>0</m>,
        there is a real number <m>N</m> such that if <m>n>N</m>,
        then <m>|s_n-s|\lt \eps</m>.

        <p>
          Clearly <m>\limit{n}{\infty}{s_n}=s</m> if and only if
          <m>\limit{n}{\infty}{\left(s_n-s\right)}=0</m>.

          Again notice that this says that we can make <m>s_n</m> as close to <m>s</m> as we wish
          (within <m>\eps</m>)
          by making <m>n</m> large enough (<m>>N)</m>.
          As before, this definition makes these notions very specific.

    <title>Double Implication</title>

    <p>
      The phrase <q>if and only if</q> (seen in item 1 above) is a term of art in
      mathematics. The symbol <q><m>\Leftrightarrow </m></q> is
      equivalent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formally it means that each statement follows
      logically from the other. If you are asked to prove the
      statement <me>A\Leftrightarrow B</me> you need to first assume that
      <m>A</m> is true to prove <m>B</m>. Then you assume that
      <m>B</m> is true to prove <m>A</m>.  
    </p>
    <p>
      In a classroom setting
      it is often abbreviated as <q>iff.</q>
    </p>
  </aside>

  <p>
    As an example, let<rsq/>s use this definition to prove that
    the sequence in part (b) of <xref
    ref="prob_sequences-not_converge_to_zero"></xref>
    converges to <m>1</m>.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="example_SeriesConverge">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove <m>\limitt{n}{\infty}{\frac{n}{n+100}}=1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <term>SCRAPWORK</term>
      </p>
      <p>
        Given an <m>\eps>0</m>, we need to get <m>\abs{\frac{n}{n+100}-1}\lt \eps</m>.
        This prompts us to do some algebra.
        <me>
          \left|\frac{n}{n+100}-1\right|=\left|\frac{n-(n+100)}{n+100}\right|\leq\frac{100}{n}
          </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This in turn,
        seems to suggest that <m>N=\frac{100}{\eps}</m> should work.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>\eps>0</m>.
      Let <m>N=\frac{100}{\eps}</m>.
      If <m>n>N</m>,
      then <m>n>\frac{100}{\eps}</m> and so <m>\frac{100}{n}\lt \eps</m>.
      Hence
      <me>
        \left|\frac{n}{n+100}-1\right|=\left|\frac{n-(n+100)}{n+100}\right|= \frac{100}{n+100}\lt \frac{100}{n}\lt \eps
        </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus by definition <m>\limitt{n}{\infty}{\frac{n}{n+100}} =1</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>


  <p>
    Notice again that the scrapwork is not part of the formal
    proof and the author of a proof is not obligated to explain
    where the choice of <m>N</m> came from (although the thought
    process can usually be seen in the formal proof).  The formal
    proof contains only these requisite three parts:

    <ul>

      <li>
        provide the
        challenge of an arbitrary <m>\eps>0</m>,
      </li>

      <li>
        provide a specific
        <m>N</m>, and
      </li>

      <li>
        show that this <m>N</m> works for the given
        <m>\eps</m>.

      </li>

    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Also notice that given a specific sequence such as
    <m>\left(\frac{n}{n+100}\right)</m>, the definition does not
    indicate what the limit would be if in fact, it exists.  Once
    an educated guess is made the definition only verifies that
    this intuition is correct.
  </p>

  <p>
    This leads to the following question: If intuition is needed to
    determine what a limit of a sequence should be, then what is the
    purpose of this relatively non<ndash/>intuitive, complicated
    definition?
  </p>

  <p>
    Remember that when these rigorous formulations were developed,
    intuitive notions of convergence were already in place and had
    been used with great success.  But the arguments based on them
    could not be fully justified. This definition was developed to
    address the foundational issues, not to help us compute limits.
  </p>
  <p>
    Could our intuitions be verified in a concrete fashion that was above reproach?
    This was the purpose of this non-intuitive definition.
    It was to be used to verify that our intuition was,
    in fact, correct and do so in a very prescribed manner.
    For example, if <m>b>0</m> is a fixed number,
    then you would probably say as <m>n</m> approaches infinity,
    <m>b^{\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)}</m> approaches <m>b^0=1</m>.
    After all, we did already prove that <m>\limit{n}{\infty}{\frac{1}{n}}=0</m>.
    We should be able to back up this intuition with our rigorous definition.

    As you saw in the <xref ref="SeqRealNum"
    text="custom">previous section</xref> the formal definition of
    the convergence of a sequence is meant to capture rigorously
    our intuitive understanding of convergence.  However, the
    definition itself is an unwieldy tool. If only there were some
    way to be rigorous without having to run back to the
    definition each time.  Fortunately, there is a way.  If we can
    use the definition to prove some general rules about limits
    then we could use these rules whenever they apply and be
    assured that everything was still rigorous.  A number of these
    should look familiar from Calculus.

      <p>
        We will often state this theorem informally as <q>the limit of
        a sum is the sum of the limits.</q> However, to be absolutely
        precise, what it says is that if we already know that two
        sequences converge, then the sequence formed by summing their
        corresponding terms  will also converge and
        in fact, it will converge to the sum of those individual limits.

            If we let <m>\eps>0</m>, then we want to find <m>N</m>

            <m>\big|\left(a_n+b_n\right)-\left(a+b\right)\big|\lt
            \eps</m>.  Since we know that
            <m>\limit{n}{\infty}{a_n}=a</m> and
            <m>\limit{n}{\infty}{b_n}=b</m>, we can make
            <m>\big|a_n-a\big|</m> and <m>\big|b_n-b\big|</m> as small
            as we wish, provided we make <m>n</m> large enough.
            Let<rsq/>s go back to what we want, to see if we can close
            the gap between what we know and what we want.  We know,
            by the triangle inequality, that

              </me>.
              To make this whole thing less than <m>\eps</m>,

        <term>SCRAPWORK:</term>
        Given <m>\eps>0</m>, we want <m>N</m> so that if <m>n>N</m>,
        then <m>\abs{a_n  b_n-a  b}\lt \eps</m>.
        One of the standard tricks in analysis is to <q>uncancel.</q>
        In this case we will subtract and add a convenient term.
        Normally these would <q>cancel out,</q>
        which is why we say that we will uncancel to put them back in.
        You already saw an example of this in proving the Reverse Triangle Inequality
        (<xref ref="Tri-RevTri-Ineq_prob"></xref>).
        In the present case, consider
        <md>
          <mrow>\abs{a_n  b_n-a  b}\amp =\abs{a_n  b_n-a_n b+a_n b-a  b}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \leq \abs{a_n  b_n-a_n  b}+\abs{a_n b-a b}|</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =\abs{a_n}\abs{b_n-b}+\abs{b}\abs{a_n-a}</mrow>
          </md>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can make this whole thing less than <m>\eps</m>, provided we
        make each term in the sum less than <m>\frac{\eps}{2}</m>.  We
        can make <m>\big|b\big|\big|a_n-a\big|\lt \frac{\eps}{2}</m> if
        we make <m>\big|a_n-a\big|\lt \frac{\eps}{2|b|}</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But wait!
        What if <m>b=0</m>? 
      </p>
      <p>
        We could handle this as a separate case or
        we can do the following <q>slick trick.</q> Notice that we can
          add one more line to the above string of inequalities:
          <me>\left|a_n\right|\left|b_n-b\right|+\left|b\right|\left|a_n-a\right|\lt
          \left|a_n
          \right|\left|b_n-b\right|+\left(\left|b\right|+1\right)\left|a_n-a
          \right|</me>.  Now we can make <m>\left|a_n-a\right|\lt
          \frac{\eps}{2\left(|b|+1\right)}</m> and not worry about
          dividing by zero.
        </p>

        <p>
          Making <m>\abs{a_n}\abs{b_n-b}\lt \frac{\eps}{2}</m> requires a bit more finesse.
          At first glance,
          one would be tempted to try and make <m>\abs{b_n-b}\lt \frac{\eps}{2|a_n|}</m>.
          Even if we ignore the fact that we could be dividing by zero
          (which we could handle),
          we have a bigger problem.
          According to the definition of <m>\limitt{n}{\infty}{b_n}=b</m>,
          we can make <m>\abs{b_n-b}</m> smaller than any given fixed positive number,
          as long as we make <m>n</m> large enough
          (larger than some <m>N</m> which goes with a given epsilon).
          Unfortunately,
          <m>\frac{\eps}{2|a_n|}</m> is not fixed as it has the variable <m>n</m> in it;
          there is no reason to believe that a single <m>N</m> will work
          with all possible values of <m>n</m> simultaneously.
          To handle this impasse, we need the following:

            <p>
              It is helpful to look first at the special case
              <me>\limitt{n}{\infty}{\left(\frac{1}{b_n}\right)}=\frac{1}{b}</me>.
              The general case will follow from this and from <xref
              ref="thm_LimitOfProduct"></xref>.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Consider
              <m>\big|\frac{1}{b_n}-\frac{1}{b}\big|=\frac{|b-b_n|}{|b_n||b|}</m>.
              We are faced with the same dilemma we had when we were
              proving <xref ref="thm_LimitOfProduct" ></xref>; we need
              to get <m>\big|\frac{1}{b_n}\big|</m> bounded above.
              This means we need to get <m>\abs{b_n}</m> bounded away from
              zero (at least for large enough <m>n</m>).
            </p>

            <p>
              This can be done as follows.
              Since <m>b\neq 0</m>, then <m>\frac{|b|}{2}>0</m>.
              Thus, by the definition of
              <m>\limit{n}{\infty}{b_n}=b</m> there exists <m>N_1</m> such that if <m>n>N_1</m>,
              then <m>\abs{b}-\abs{b_n}\leq\big|b-b_n\big|\lt \frac{\abs{b}}{2}</m>.
              Thus when <m>n>N_1</m>,
              <m>\frac{\abs{b}}{2}\lt \abs{b_n}</m> and so <m>\frac{1}{\abs{b_n}}\lt \frac{2}{\abs{b}}</m>.
              This says that for <m>n>N_1</m>,
              <m>\frac{\abs{b-b_n}}{\abs{b_n}\abs{b}}\lt \frac{2}{\abs{b}^2}\abs{b-b_n}</m>.
              We should be able to make this smaller than a given <m>\eps>0</m>, 
              provided we make <m>n</m> large enough.

            The Squeeze Theorem is true even if <m>r_n\leq s_n\leq
            t_n</m> only holds for sufficiently large <m>n</m>; i.e.,
            for <m>n</m> larger than some fixed <m>N_0</m>.  This is
            true because when you find an <m>N_1</m> that works in the
            original proof, this can be modified by choosing
            <m>N=</m>max<m>\left(N_0,N_1\right)</m>.  Also note that
            this theorem really says two things:
            <ol>
              <li>
                <m>\left(s_n\right)</m> converges, and

              <li>
                it converges to
                <m>s</m>.
              </li>
            </ol>
            This subtle point affects how one should
            properly use the Squeeze Theorem.

            <p>
              Look again at  <xref ref="example_SqzeEx"></xref>.
              Notice that
              <me>
                0\leq\frac{n+1}{n^2}\leq\frac{n+n}{n^2}=\frac{2}{n}

                so

                  0=\limit{n}{\infty}{0} \leq \limit{n}{\infty}{\frac{n+1}{n^2}}\leq\limit{n}{\infty}{\frac{2}{n}}=0

              If we knew that the limit existed to begin with, then this would be fine.
              The Squeeze Theorem proves that the limit does in fact exist,

            The general theorems we have seen in this section will
            allow us to rigorously explore convergence of power series
            in the next chapter without appealing directly to the
            definitions.  However there will still be
            times when we will need to apply the definition directly.

    <section xml:id="DivergentSeq">
      <title>Divergence</title>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="thm_rearrangements"></xref>
        we saw that there is a rearrangment of the alternating Harmonic series which diverges to <m>\infty</m> or <m>-\infty</m>.
        In that section we did not fuss over any formal notions of divergence.
        We assumed instead that you are already familiar with the concept of divergence,
        probably from taking Calculus in the past.
      </p>

      <p>
        However we are now in the process of building precise,
        formal definitions for the concepts we will be using so we define the divergence of a sequence as follows.
      </p>

      <definition xml:id="thm_divergence_of_a_sequence">
        <statement>
          <p>
            <idx><h>sequences</h><h>divergence of</h></idx>
            <idx><h>divergence</h><h> of a sequence</h></idx>
            A sequence of real numbers <m>\left(s_n\right)_{n=1}^\infty</m> diverges if it does not converge to any <m>a\in\RR</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>

      <p>
        It may seem unnecessarily pedantic of us to insist on formally stating such an obvious definition.
        After all <q>converge</q> and <q>diverge</q>
        are opposites in ordinary English.
        Why wouldn<rsq/>t they be mathematically opposite too?
        Why do we have to go to the trouble of formally defining both of them?
        Since they are opposites defining one implicitly defines the other doesn<rsq/>t it?
      </p>

      <p>
        One way to answer that criticism is to state that in mathematics we <em>always</em>
        work from precisely stated definitions and tightly reasoned logical arguments.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this is just more pedantry.
        It is a way of saying, <q>Because we said so</q>
        all dressed up in imposing language.
        We need to do better than that.
      </p>

      <p>
        One reason for providing formal definitions of both convergence and divergence is that in mathematics we frequently co-opt words from natural languages like English and imbue them with mathematical meaning that is only tangentially related to the original English definition.
        When we take two such words which happen to be opposites in English and give them mathematical meanings which are <em>not</em>
        opposites it can be very confusing, especially at first.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is what happened with the words
        <q>open</q> and <q>closed.</q>
        These are opposites in English:
        <q>not open</q> is <q>closed,</q>
        <q>not closed</q> is <q>open,</q>
        and there is nothing which is both open and closed.
        But recall that an open interval on the real line, <m>(a,b)</m>,
        is one that does not include <em>either</em>
        of its endpoints while a closed interval, <m>[a,b]</m>,
        is one that includes both of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        These may seem like opposites at first but they are not.  To see
        this observe that the interval <m>(a,b]</m> is neither open nor
        closed since it only contains one of its endpoints. If
        <q>open</q> and <q>closed</q> were mathematically opposite then
        <em>every</em> interval would be either open or closed.
      </p>
      <aside>
        <title>
          Open Sets vs. Closed Sets
        </title>
        <p>
          It is also true that <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m> is
          <em>both</em> open and closed. We will discuss this a bit further in <xref ref="SECTIONRiseSetTheory" ></xref>.
          
        </p>
      </aside>

      <p>
          Mathematicians have learned to be extremely careful about this sort of thing.
          In the case of convergence and divergence of a series,
          even though these words are actually opposites mathematically
          (every sequence either converges or diverges and no sequence converges <em>and</em> diverges)
          it is better to say this explicitly so there can be no confusion.
        </p>

        <p>
          A sequence <m>\left(a_n\right)_{n=1}^\infty</m> can only converge to a real number,
          <m>a</m>,
          in one way:
          by getting arbitrarily close to <m>a</m>.
          However there are several ways a sequence might diverge.
        </p>

        <example xml:id="EXAMPLEDivOfn">
          <statement>
            <p>
              Consider the sequence, <m>\left(n\right)_{n=1}^\infty</m>.
              This clearly diverges by getting larger and larger <m>\ldots</m> Ooops!
              Let<rsq/>s be careful.
              The sequence <m>\left(1-\frac1n\right)_{n=1}^\infty</m> gets larger and larger too,
              but it converges.
              What we meant to say was that the terms of the sequence
              <m>\left(n\right)_{n=1}^\infty</m> become <term>arbitrarily</term>
              large as <m>n</m> increases.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is clearly a divergent sequence but it may not be clear how to prove it formally.
              Here<rsq/>s one way.
            </p>

            <p>
              To show divergence we must show that the sequence
              satisfies the negation of the definition of convergence.
              That is, we must show that for every <m>r\in\RR</m>
              there is an <m>\eps>0</m> such that for every
              <m>N\in\RR</m>, there is an <m>n>N</m> with
              <m>\left|n-r\right|\ge\eps</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              To prove that the sequence diverges let <m>N\in \RR </m>
              and <m>r\in \RR </m> be given. Take <m>\eps=1</m>. Let
              <m>N_0</m> be the smallest positive integer which is
              greater than <m>r</m>. Finally take <m>n</m> to be
              greater than <m>N</m>, <m>N_0</m> and <m>r+2</m>.
            </p>
<p>
  Since <m>n\gt N_0 \gt r</m> we see that <m> \abs{n-r}=n-r\gt 0</m>.
  Thus
  <men xml:id="EQUATIONIntSerDiv">
    \abs{n-r}=n-r\ge(r+2)-r=2>\eps=1
    </men>.


    Therefore the sequence <m>\left(n\right)_{n-1}^\infty </m> diverges.

  </p>

</statement>
        </example>


        <!-- <p> -->
        <!--   Since it is intuitively clear that -->
        <!--   <m>\left(n\right)_{n=1}^\infty</m> does not converge the -->

        <!-- </p> -->
        <p>
          The fact that <m>\left(n\right)_{n=1}^\infty </m> diverges can be
          proved by simpler means than we used in <xref
          ref="EXAMPLEDivOfn" ></xref>. For example, we could  use <xref

              The fact is that mathematical definitions are not
              primarily intended to serve as tools for problem solving
              (theorem proving). The chief purpose of a definition
              is to clarify our ideas and make them precise. Lemmas
              and theorems (the solutions of problems) are then built up
              logically from definitions. And they provide the tools
              we need to solve more difficult, or abstract problems
              (prove lemmas and theorems). Recall that in <xref

              </problem>



              <p>
                We will denote divergence to infinity as
                <me>
                  \limit{n}{\infty}{a_n}=\pm\infty
                  </me>.
              </p>

              <p>
                However, strictly speaking this is an abuse of notation since the symbol <m>\infty</m> does not represent a real number.
                This notation can be very problematic since it looks so much like the notation we use to denote convergence:
                <m>\limit{n}{\infty}{a_n}=a</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Nevertheless,
                the notation is appropriate because divergence to infinity is <q>nice</q>
                divergence in the sense that it shares many of the properties of convergence,
                as the next problem shows.

              <p>
                Because divergence to positive or negative infinity shares some
                of the properties of convergence it is easy to get careless with
                it.  Remember that even though we write
                <m>\limit{n}{\infty}{a_n}=\infty</m> this is still a divergent
                sequence in the sense that <m>\limit{n}{\infty}{a_n}</m> does
                not exist.  The symbol <m>\infty</m> does not represent a real
                number.  This is just a convenient notational shorthand telling
                us that the sequence diverges by becoming arbitrarily large.
