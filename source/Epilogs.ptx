    <title>Epilog #1: On the Nature of Numbers: A Dialogue (with Apologies to
    Galileo)</title>

    <p>
      <alert>Interlocuters</alert>: <em>Salviati, Sagredo,
      and Simplicio; Three Friends of Galileo Galilei</em>
    </p>
    <p> <alert>Setting</alert>: Three friends meet in a garden for
    lunch in Renaissance Italy.  Prior to their meal they discuss
    the book
    <pubtitle>
      A Contextual Introduction to Real Analysis: How We Got From There To Here
    </pubtitle>
    .
    How they obtained a copy is not clear.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>: My good sirs.
      I have read this very strange volume as I hope you have?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>: I have and I also found it very strange.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>: Very strange indeed;
      at once silly and mystifying.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>: Silly?
      How so?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>:
      These authors begin their tome with the question,
      <q>What is a number?</q> This is an unusually silly question,
      don<rsq/>t you think?
      Numbers are numbers.
      Everyone knows what they are.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>: I thought so as well until I reached the
      last chapter.  But now I am not so certain.  What about this
      quantity <m>\aleph_0?</m> If this counts the positive integers,
      isn<rsq/>t it a number?  If not, then how can it count anything?
      If so, then what number is it?  These questions plague me
      <lsq/>til I scarcely believe I know anything anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>: Of course <m>\aleph_0</m> is not a number!
      It is simply a new name for the infinite,
      and infinity is not a number.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>: But isn<rsq/>t
      <m>\aleph_0</m> the cardinality of the set of natural numbers,
      <m>\NN</m>,
      in just the same way that the cardinality of the set
      <m>S=\left\{Salviati, Sagredo, Simplicio\right\}</m> is <m>3?</m> If <m>3</m> is a number,
      then why isn<rsq/>t <m>\aleph_0?</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>: Ah, my friend,
      like our authors you are simply playing with words.
      You count the elements in the set
      <m>S=\left\{Salviati, Sagredo, Simplicio\right\};</m> you see plainly that the
      number of elements
      it contains is <m>3</m> and then you change your language.
      Rather than saying that the number of elements
      in <m>S</m> is <m>3</m> you say that the
      <term>cardinality</term> is <m>3</m>.
      But clearly <q>cardinality</q>
      and <q>number of elements</q> mean the same thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly you use the symbol <m>\NN</m> to denote the set of positive integers.
      With your new word and symbol you make the statement
      <q>the <term>cardinality</term>
      (number of elements)
      of <m>\NN</m> is <m>\aleph_0</m>.</q>
      This statement has the same grammatical form as the statement <q>the
      number of elements
      (cardinality) of <m>S</m> is three.</q> Since three is
      a number you conclude that <m>\aleph_0</m> is also a number.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this is simply nonsense dressed up to sound sensible.
      If we unwind our notation and language, your statement is simply,
      <q>The number of positive integers is infinite.</q>
      This is obviously nonsense because infinity is not a number.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if we take infinity as an undefined term and try to define it by your statement this is still nonsense since you are using the word <q>number</q>
      to define a new <q>number</q> called infinity.
      This definition is circular.
      Thus it is no definition at all.
      It is nonsense.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>: Your reasoning on this certainly seems sound.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>: Thank you.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>:  However,
      there are a couple of small points I would like to examine more closely if you will indulge me?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>: Of course.
      What troubles you?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>: You<rsq/>ve said that we cannot use the word <q>number</q>
      to define numbers because this would be circular reasoning.
      I entirely agree,
      but I am not sure this is what our authors are doing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider the set <m>\left\{1, 2, 3\right\}</m>.
      Do you agree that it contains three elements?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>: Obviously.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>: Ah!  I see your point!  That there are
      three elements does not depend on what those elements
      are.  Any set with three elements has three elements
      regardless of the nature of the elements.  Thus saying that
      the set <m>\left\{1, 2, 3\right\}</m> contains three elements
      does not define the word <q>number</q> in a circular manner
      because it is irrelevant that the number 3 is one of
      the elements of the set.  Thus to say that three is the
      cardinality of the set <m>\left\{1, 2, 3\right\}</m> has the
      same meaning as saying that there are three elements in the
      set <m>\left\{Salviati, Sagredo, Simplicio\right\}</m>.  In
      both cases the number <q><m>3</m></q> is the name that we give
      to the totality of the elements of each set.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>:  Precisely.
      In exactly the same way <m>\aleph_0</m> is the symbol we use to denote the totality of the set of positive integers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus <m>\aleph_0</m> is a number in the same sense that <sq><m>3</m></sq> is a number,
      is it not?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  I see that we can say in a meaningful way that three is the cardinality of any set with<nbsp />.<nbsp />.<nbsp />.<nbsp />well,<nbsp />.<nbsp />.<nbsp />.<nbsp />with three elements
      (it becomes very difficult to talk about these things)
      but this is simply a tautology!
      It is a way of saying that a set which has three elements has three elements!
    </p>

    <p>
      This means only that we have counted them and we had to stop at three.
      In order to do this we must have numbers first.
      Which, of course, we do.
      As I said, everyone knows what numbers are.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  I must confess,
      my friend, that I become more confused as we speak.
      I am no longer certain that I really know what a number is.
      Since you seem to have retained your certainty can you clear this up for me?
      Can you tell me what a number is?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  Certainly.
      A number is what we have just been discussing.
      It is what you have when you stop counting.
      For example, three is the totality
      (to use your phrase)
      of the elements of the sets <m>\left\{Salviati, Sagredo, Simplicio\right\}</m> or
      <m>\left\{1, 2, 3\right\}</m> because when I count the elements in either set I have to stop at three.
      Nothing less, nothing more.
      Thus three is a number.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>:  But this definition only confuses me!
      Surely you will allow that fractions are numbers?
      What is counted when we end with,
      say <m>4/5</m> or <m>1/5?</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>: This is simplicity itself.  <m>4/5</m> is
      the number we get when we have divided something into <m>5</m> equal
      pieces and we have counted four of these fifths.  This is
      four<ndash/>fifths.  You see?  Even the language we use naturally
      bends itself to our purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>:  But what of one-fifth?
      In order to count one fifth we must first divide something into fifths.
      To do this we must know what one-fifth is, musn<rsq/>t we?
      We seem to be using the word <q>number</q> to define itself again.
      Have we not come full circle and gotten nowhere?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  I confess this had not occurred to me before.
      But your objection is easily answered.
      To count one-fifth we simply divide our
      <q>something</q> into tenths.
      Then we count two of them.
      Since two-tenths is the same as one-fifth the problem is solved.
      Do you see?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  I see your point but it will not suffice at all!
      It merely replaces the question,
      <q>What is one-fifth?</q> with,
      <q>What is one-tenth?</q> Nor will it do to say that one-tenth is merely two-twentieths.
      This simply shifts the question back another level.
    </p>

    <p>
      Archimedes said,
      <q>Give me a place to stand and a lever long enough and I will move the earth.</q>
      But of course he never moved the earth because he had nowhere to stand.
      We seem to find ourselves in Archimedes<rsq/> predicament: We have no place to stand.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  I confess I don<rsq/>t see a way to answer this right now.
      However I<rsq/>m sure an answer can be found if we only think hard enough.
      In the meantime I cannot accept that <m>\aleph_0</m> is a number.
      It is, as I said before, infinity and infinity is not a number!
      We may as well believe in fairies and leprechauns if we call infinity a number.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  But again we<rsq/>ve come full circle.
      We cannot say definitively that
      <m>\aleph_0</m> is or is not a number until we can state with confidence what a number is.
      And even if we could find solid ground on which to solve the problem of fractions,
      what of <m>\sqrt{2}?</m> Or <m>\pi?</m> Certainly these are numbers but I see no way to count to either of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  Alas!
      I am beset by demons!
      I am bewitched!
      I no longer believe what I know to be true!
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>:  Perhaps things are not quite as bad as that.
      Let us consider further.
      You said earlier that we all know what numbers are, and I agree.
      But perhaps your statement needs to be more precisely formulated.
      Suppose we say instead that we all know what numbers need to be?
      Or that we know what we want numbers to be?
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if we cannot say with certainly what numbers are
      surely we can say what we want and need for them to be.
      Do you agree?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  I do.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  And so do I.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>:  Then let us invent numbers anew,
      as if we<rsq/>ve never seen them before,
      always keeping in mind those properties we need for numbers to have.
      If we take this as a starting point then the question we need to address is,
      <q>What do we need numbers to be?</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  This is obvious!
      We need to be able to add them and we need to be able to multiply them together,
      and the result should also be a number.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  And subtract and divide too, of course.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  I am not so sure we actually need these.
      Could we not define <q>subtract two from three</q>
      to be <q>add negative two to three</q>
      and thus dispense with subtraction and division?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  I suppose we can but I see no advantage in doing so.
      Why not simply have subtraction and division as we<rsq/>ve always known them?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  The advantage is parsimony.
      Two arithmetic operations are easier to keep track of than four.
      I suggest we go forward with only addition and multiplication for now.
      If we find we need subtraction or division we can consider them later.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  Agreed.
      And I now see another advantage.
      Obviously addition and multiplication must not depend on order.
      That is, if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are numbers then <m>x+y</m> must be equal to <m>y+x</m> and <m>xy</m> must be equal to <m>yx</m>.
      This is not true for subtraction,
      for <m>3-2</m> does not equal <m>2-3</m>.
      But if we define subtraction as you suggest then this symmetry is preserved:
      <me>
        x+(-y) = (-y)+x
        </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  Excellent!
      Another property we will require of numbers occurs to me now.
      When adding or multiplying more than two numbers it should not matter where we begin.
      That is, if <m>x</m>,
      <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> are numbers it should be true that
      <me>
        (x+y)+z = x+(y+z)
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        (x\cdot y)\cdot z = x\cdot(y\cdot z)
        </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  Yes!
      We have it!
      Any objects which combine in these precise ways can be called numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>:  Certainly these properties are necessary,
      but I don<rsq/>t think they are yet sufficient to our purpose.
      For example,
      the number <m>1</m> is unique in that it is the only number which,
      when multiplying another number leaves it unchanged.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example:  <m>1\cdot3=3</m>.
      Or, in general, if <m>x</m> is a number then <m>1\cdot x =x</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  Yes.
      Indeed.
      It occurs to me that the number zero plays a similar role for addition:
      <m>0+x=x</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>:  It does not seem to me that addition and multiplication,
      as we have defined them,
      force <m>1</m> or <m>0</m> into existence so I believe we will have to postulate their existence independently.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  Is this everything then?
      Is this all we require of numbers?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  I don<rsq/>t think we are quite done yet.
      How shall we get division?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>: In the same way that we defined subtraction
      to be the addition of a negative number, can we not define division
      to be multiplication by a reciprocal?  For example, <m>3</m> divided
      by <m>2</m> can be considered <m>3</m> multiplied by <m>1/2</m>, can
      it not?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>: I think it can.  But observe that every
      number will need to have a corresponding negative so that we can
      subtract any amount.  And again nothing we<rsq/>ve discussed so far
      forces these negative numbers into existence so we will have to
      postulate their existence separately.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  And in the same way every number will need a reciprocal so that we can divide by any amount.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  Every number that is, except zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  Yes, this is true.
      Strange is it not,
      that of them all only this one number needs no reciprocal?
      Shall we also postulate that zero has no reciprocal?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>: I don<rsq/>t see why we should.
      Possibly <m>\aleph_0</m> is the reciprocal of zero.
      Or possibly not.
      But I see no need to concern ourselves with things we do not need.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>: Is this everything then?
      Have we discovered all that we need for numbers to be?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>: I believe there is only one property missing.
      We have postulated addition and we have postulated multiplication and we have described the numbers zero and one which play similar roles for addition and multiplication respectively.
      But we have not described how addition and multiplication work together.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is, we need a rule of distribution:  If <m>x</m>,
      <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> are all numbers then
      <me>
        x\cdot(y+z) = x\cdot y+x\cdot z
        </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      With this in place I believe we have everything we need.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  Indeed.
      We can also see from this that
      <m>\aleph_0</m> cannot be a number since,
      in the first place,
      it cannot be added to another number and in the second,
      even if it could be added to a number the result is surely not also a number.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>:  My dear Simplicio, I fear you have missed the point entirely!
      Our axioms do not declare what a number is,
      only how it behaves with respect to addition and multiplication with other numbers.
      Thus it is a mistake to presume that <q>numbers</q>
      are only those objects that we have always believed them to be.
      In fact, it now occurs to me that
      <q>addition</q> and <q>multiplication</q>
      also needn<rsq/>t be seen as the operations we have always believed them to be.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example suppose we have three objects,
      <m>\left\{a, b, c\right\}</m> and suppose that we define <q>addition</q>
      and <q>multiplication</q> by the following tables:
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \begin{array}{c|ccc}
          +\amp a\amp b\amp c\\\hline
          a\amp a\amp b\amp c\\
          b\amp b\amp c\amp a\\
          c\amp c\amp a\amp b
          \end{array}
          \amp \amp \amp \amp \amp \amp
          \begin{array}{c|ccc}
          \cdot\amp a\amp b\amp c\\\hline
          a\amp a\amp a\amp a\\
          b\amp a\amp b\amp c\\
          c\amp a\amp c\amp b
          \end{array}
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      I submit that our set along with these definitions satisfy all of our axioms and thus <m>a</m>,
      <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> qualify to be called <q>numbers.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  This cannot be!
      There is no zero, no one!
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  But there is.
      Do you not see that <m>a</m> plays the role of zero <mdash /> if you add it to any number you get that number back.
      Similarly <m>b</m> plays the role of one.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>: This is astonishing!  If <m>a, b</m> and
      <m>c</m> can be numbers then I am less sure than ever that I know
      what numbers are!  Why, if we replace <m>a, b</m>, and <m>c</m> with
      <em>Simplicio</em> <em>Sagredo,</em> and <em>Salviati</em> then
      we become numbers ourselves!
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>: Perhaps we will have to be content with
      knowing how numbers behave rather than knowing what they are.
    </p>

    <p>
      However I confess that I have a certain affection for the numbers I grew up with.
      Let us call those the <q>real</q> numbers.
      Any other set of numbers,
      such as our <m>\left\{a,b,c\right\}</m> above we will call a field of numbers,
      since they seem to provide us with new ground to explore.
      Or perhaps just a <term>number field</term>?
    </p>

    <p>
      As we have been discussing this I have been writing down our
      axioms.  They are these.  Numbers are any objects which satisfy
      all of the following properties:
    </p>


    <axiom>
      <title>Definition of Operations</title>

    <title> Epilog #2: Building the Real Numbers</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Contrary to the title of this section we will not be rigorously
        building the real numbers here.  Instead our goal is to show why
        such a build is logically necessary, and to give a sense of some
        of the ways this has been accomplished in the past.  This may
        seem odd given our uniform emphasis on mathematical rigor,
        especially in the third part of the text, but there are very
        good reasons for this.
      </p>

      <p>
        One is simple practicality.  The fact is that rigorously
        building the real numbers and then showing that they have
        the required properties is extraordinarily detailed work,
        even for mathematics.  If we want to keep this text to a
        manageable size (we do), we simply don<rsq/>t have the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second reason is that there is, as far as we know, very
        little for you to gain by it.  When we are done we will have the
        real numbers.  The same real numbers you have been using all of
        your life.  They have the same properties, and quirks, they<rsq/>ve
        always had.  To be sure, they will not have lost any of their
        charm. They will be the same delightful mix of the mundane and
        the bizarre, and they are still well worth exploring and getting
        to know better.  But nothing we do in the course of building
        them up logically from simpler ideas will help with that
        exploration.
      </p>

      <p>
        A reasonable question then, is,
        <q>Why bother?</q> If the process is overwhelmingly, tediously detailed
        (it is)
        and gives us nothing new for our efforts, why do it at all?
      </p>

      <p>
        <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wiles/" >Andrew Wiles</url> has compared
        doing mathematics to entering a dark room. At
        first you are lost.  The layout of the room and furniture are
        unknown so you fumble about for a bit and slowly get a sense of
        your immediate environs, perhaps a vague notion of the
        organization of the room as a whole.  Eventually, after much,
        often tedious exploration, you become quite comfortable in your
        room.  But always there will be dark corners; hidden areas you
        have not yet explored.  Such a dark area may hide anything; the
        latches to unopened doors you didn<rsq/>t know were there; a clamp
        whose presence explains why you couldn<rsq/>t move that little desk
        in the corner; even the light switch that would allow you to
        illuminate an area more clearly than you would have imagined
        possible.

      <p>
        But, and this is the point, there is no way to know what you
        will find there until you walk into that dark corner and begin
        exploring.  Perhaps nothing.  But perhaps something wonderful.

      <p>
        <idx><h>measure zero</h></idx>

        This is what happened in the late nineteenth century.  The real
        numbers had been used since the Pythagoreans learned that
        <m>\sqrt{2}</m> was irrational.  But really, most calculations
        were (and still are) done with just the rational numbers.
        Moreover, since <m>\QQ</m> forms a <q>set of measure
        zero,</q>
        it is clear that most of the real numbers had gone completely unused.
        The set of real numbers was thus one of those
        <q>dark corners</q> of mathematics.
        It had to be explored.

      <p>
        <q>But even if that is true,</q> you might ask, <q>I have
        no interest in the logical foundations of the real
        numbers, especially if such knowledge won<rsq/>t tell me
        anything I don<rsq/>t already know.  Why do I need to know all
        of the details of constructing <m>\RR</m> from
        <m>\QQ?</m></q>
      </p>

      <p>
        The answer to this is very simple: You don<rsq/>t.
      </p>

      <p>
        That<rsq/>s the other reason we<rsq/>re not covering all of the
        details of this material.  We will explain enough to light
        up, dimly perhaps, this little corner of mathematics.
        Later, should you need (or want) to come back to this and
        explore further you will have a foundation to start with.
        Nothing more.  </p> <p> Until the nineteenth century the
        geometry of Euclid, as given in his book <pubtitle>The
        Elements,</pubtitle> was universally regarded as the touchstone
        of mathematical perfection.  This belief was so deeply
        embedded in Western culture that as recently as 1923, Edna
        St. Vincent Millay opened one of the poems in her
        book <pubtitle>The Harp Weaver and Other Poems</pubtitle> with the
        line <q>Euclid alone has looked on beauty bare.</q>
      </p>

      <p>
        Euclid begins his book by stating <m>5</m> <term>Common
        Notions</term> (essentially some elementary rules of logic)
        and <m>5</m> simple geometric <term>Axioms</term> and
        proceeds, step by logical step, to build up his geometry.
        Although far from actual perfection, his methods are clean,
        precise and efficient <mdash /> he arrives at the Pythagorean
        Theorem in only <m>47</m> steps (theorems) <mdash /> and even
        today Euclid<rsq/>s <pubtitle>The Elements</pubtitle> still sets a
        very high standard of mathematical exposition and parsimony.

        The goal of starting with what is clear and simple and
        proceeding logically, rigorously, to what is complex is
        still a guiding principle of all mathematics for a variety
        of reasons.  In the late nineteenth century, this principle
        was brought to bear on the real numbers.  That is, some
        properties of the real numbers that at first seem simple and
        intuitively clear turn out on closer examination, as we have
        seen, to be rather counter-intuitive.  This alone is not
        really a problem.  We can have counter-intuitive properties
        in our mathematics <mdash /> indeed, this is a big part of
        what makes mathematics interesting <mdash /> as long as we
        arrive at them logically, starting from simple assumptions
        the same way Euclid did.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having arrived at a view of the real numbers which is comparable to that of our nineteenth century colleagues,
        it should now be clear that the real numbers and their properties must be built up from simpler concepts as suggested by our Italian friends in the previous section.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to those properties we have discovered so far,
        both <m>\QQ</m> and <m>\RR</m> share another property which will be useful.
        We have used it throughout this text but have not heretofore made it explicit.
        They are both <term>linearly ordered</term>.
        We will now make this property explicit.

      </problem>

      <p>
        In a thorough, rigorous presentation we would now assume the
        existence of the natural numbers <m>(\NN)</m>, and their
        properties and use these to define the integers,
        <m>(\ZZ)</m>.  We would then use the integers to define the
        rational numbers, <m>(\QQ)</m>.  We could then show that the
        rationals satisfy the field axioms worked out in the
        previous section, and that they are linearly ordered.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then <mdash /> at last <mdash /> we would use <m>\QQ</m> to
        define the real numbers <m>(\RR)</m>, show that these
        satisfy the field axioms and also have the other properties
        we expect:  The <xref ref="NIP" text="custom">Nested Interval Property</xref> , the
        <xref ref="def_LeastUpperBound" text="custom">Least Upper Bound Property</xref>, the <xref ref="BolzanoWeierstrass" text="custom">Bolzano<ndash/>Weierstrass Theorem</xref>,
        the <xref ref="thm_Cauchy-_Converge" text="custom">convergence of all Cauchy sequences</xref>, and <xref ref="def_NumberField" text="custom">linear
        ordering</xref>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We would start with the natural numbers because they seem to
        be simple enough that we can simply assume their properties.
        As <url
        href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Kronecker/"
        >
        Leopold Kronecker</url> (1823-1891) said: <q>God made the
        natural numbers, all else is the work of man.</q>
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately this is rather a lot to fit into this epilog
        so we will have to abbreviate the process rather severely.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will assume the existence and properties of the rational
        numbers.  Building <m>\QQ</m> from the integers is not
        especially hard and it is easy to show that they satisfy the
        axioms worked out by Salviati, Sagredo and Simplicio in the
        previous section.  But the level of detail required for rigor
        quickly becomes onerous.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even starting at this fairly advanced position in the chain
        of logic there is still a considerable level of detail
        needed to complete the process.  Therefore our exposition
        will necessarily be incomplete.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than display, in full rigor, how the real numbers can
        be built up from the rationals we will show, in fairly broad
        terms, three ways this has been done in the past.  We will
        give references later in case you<rsq/>d like to follow up and
        learn more.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection xml:id="DecimalExpansion">
      <title>The Decimal Expansion</title>
      <p>
        This is by far the most straightforward method we will
        examine.  Observe that if <m>x\in\QQ</m> then expressing
        <m>x</m> as a decimal gives a <term>repeating infinite
        decimal</term>. For example <m>\frac{1}{4}=0.25000\ldots{}</m>
        where zero is repeated and <m>\frac13 =0.333\ldots{}</m>
        where three is repeated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before going further there is a small detail that needs to be
        addressed. Since <m>1.000\ldots=0.999\ldots{}</m> we see that there are two
        ways to represent <m>1</m> as a repeating decimal. In fact any decimal
        that eventually repeats <m>9</m> will have two possible decimal
        representations, one with repeating zeros and the other with
        repeating nines. For full rigor we need to systematically choose one
        or the other. It doesn<rsq/>t matter which.
      </p>


      <p>
        We would like to define <m>\QQ</m> to be the set of all
        decimal expressions which eventually repeat,    If it
        eventually repeats zeros or nines then it is what we<rsq/>ve
        called a finite decimal.
      </p>


      <p>
        We then define the real numbers to be the set of all
        infinite decimals, repeating or not.
      </p>

      <p>
        It may feel as if all we have to do is define addition and
        multiplication in the obvious fashion and we are finished.
        This set with these definitions obviously satisfy all of the
        field axioms worked out by our Italian friends in the
        previous section.  Moreover it seems clear that all of our
        equivalent completeness axioms are satisfied.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, things are not quite as clear cut as they seem.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary difficulty in this approach is that the decimal
        representation of the real numbers is so familiar that
        everything we need to show seems obvious.  But stop
        and think for a moment.  Is it really obvious how to define
        addition and multiplication of infinite decimals?
        Consider the addition algorithm we were all taught in grade
        school.  That algorithm requires that we line up two numbers
        at their decimal points:
        <md>
          <mrow>d_1d_2\amp .d_3d_4</mrow>
          <mrow>+\   \delta_1\delta_2\amp .\delta_3\delta_4</mrow>
          </md>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We then begin adding in the rightmost column and proceed to
        the left.  But if our decimals are infinite we can<rsq/>t get
        started because there is no rightmost column!
      </p>

      <p>
        A similar problem occurs with multiplication.
      </p>

      <p>
        So our first problem is to define addition and
        multiplication in <m>\RR</m> in a manner that re-captures
        addition and multiplication in <m>\QQ</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not a trivial task.
      </p>

      <p>
        One way to proceed is to recognize that the decimal notation
        we<rsq/>ve used all of our lives is really shorthand for the sum
        of an infinite series.  That is, if
        <m>x=0.d_1d_2d_3\ldots</m> where <m>0\leq d_i\leq 9</m> for
        all <m>i\in\NN</m> then
        <me>
          x=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{d_i}{10^i}
          </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Addition is now apparently easy to define: If
        <m>x=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{d_i}{10^i}</m> and <m>y=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{\delta_i}{10^i}</m> then
        <me>
          x+y= \sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{e_i}{10^i} \text{ where \(e_i =d_i+\delta_i\). }
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        But there is a problem.  Suppose for some <m>j\in\NN</m>,
        <m>e_j=d_j+\delta_j>10</m>.  In that case our sum does not
        satisfy the condition <m>0\leq e_j\leq 9</m> so it is not
        even clear that the expression
        <m>\sum_{j=1}^\infty\frac{e_j}{10^j}</m> represents a real
        number.  That is, we may not have the closure property of a
        number field.  We will have to define some sort of
        <q>carrying</q> operation to handle this.
      </p>

      <problem>
        <idx><h>Problems</h><h>defining infinite decimal addition</h></idx>
        
        <idx><h sortby="real"><m>\RR</m></h><h>defining infinite decimal addition</h></idx>

        <statement>
          <p>
            Define addition on infinite decimals in a manner that is closed.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Find an appropriate <q>carry</q> operation for our definition.
          </p>
        </hint>
      </problem>

      <p>
        A similar difficulty arises when we try to define
        multiplication.  Once we have a notion of carrying in place,
        we could define multiplication as just the multiplication of
        series.  Specifically, we could define
        <md>
          <mrow>(0.a_1a_2a_3\ldots)\cdot(0.b_1b_2b_3\ldots) \amp =\left(\frac{a_1}{10}+\frac{a_2}{10^2}+\cdots\right) \cdot\left(\frac{b_1}{10}+\frac{b_2}{10^2}+\cdots\right)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =\frac{a_1b_1}{10^2}+\frac{a_1b_2+a_2b_1}{10^3}+\frac{a_1b_3+a_2b_2+a_3b_1}{10^4}+\cdots</mrow>
          </md>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We could then convert this to a <q>proper</q> decimal using
        our carrying operation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Again the devil is in the details to show that such
        algebraic operations satisfy everything we want them to.
        Even then, we need to worry about linearly ordering these
        numbers and our completeness axiom.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another way of looking at this is to think of an infinite
        decimal representation as a (Cauchy) sequence of finite
        decimal approximations.  Since we know how to add and
        multiply finite decimal representations, we can just add and
        multiply the individual terms in the sequences.  Of course,
        there is no reason to restrict ourselves to only these
        specific types of Cauchy sequences, as we see in our next
        approach.
      </p>

    <subsection xml:id="CauchySequences">
      <title>Cauchy Sequences</title>
      <p>
        <idx><h>Cantor, Georg</h></idx>

        As we<rsq/>ve seen, Georg Cantor began his career studying
        Fourier series and quickly moved on to more foundational
        matters in the theory of infinite sets.
      </p>

      <p>
        <idx><h>Dedekind, Richard</h></idx>

        But he did not lose his fascination with real analysis when
        he moved on.  Like many mathematicians of his time, he
        realized the need to build <m>\RR</m> from <m>\QQ</m>.  He
        and his friend and mentor Richard Dedekind  (who<rsq/>s approach we will see in the next
        section) both found different ways to build <m>\RR</m> from
        <m>\QQ</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cantor started with Cauchy sequences in <m>\QQ</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is, we consider the set of all Cauchy sequences of
        rational numbers.  We would like to define each
        such sequence to be a real number.  The goal should be
        clear.  If <m>\left(s_n\right)_{n=1}^\infty</m> is a
        sequence in <m>\QQ</m> which converges to <m>\sqrt{2}</m>
        then we will call <m>\left(s_n\right)</m> the real number
        <m>\sqrt{2}</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This probably seems a bit startling at first.  There are a lot of
        numbers in <m>\left(s_n\right)</m> (countably infinitely many, to
        be precise) and we are proposing putting all of them into a big
        bag, tying it up in a ribbon, and calling the whole thing
        <m>\sqrt{2}</m>.  It seems a very odd thing to propose, but recall
        from the discussion in the previous section that we left the
        concept of <q>number</q> undefined.  Thus if we can take any set
        of objects and define addition and multiplication in such a way
        that the field axioms are satisfied, then those objects are
        legitimately numbers.  To show that they are, in fact, the
        <term>real numbers</term> <m>\left(\RR\right)</m> we will also
        need the completeness property.
      </p>

      <p>
        A bag full of rational numbers works as well as anything
        if we can define addition and multiplication
        appropriately.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our immediate problem though is not addition or
        multiplication but uniqueness.  If we take one sequence
        <m>\left(s_n\right)</m> which converges to <m>\sqrt{2}</m>
        and define it to be <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, what will we do with
        all of the other sequences that converge to <m>\sqrt{2}?</m>
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, we have to be careful not to refer to any real numbers, like
        the square root of two for example, as we define the real numbers.
        This would be a circular <mdash /> and thus useless <mdash />
        definition.  Obviously though, we can refer to <term>rational
        numbers</term> <m>\left(\QQ\right) </m>, since these are the tools
        we<rsq/>ll be using.
      </p>

      <p>
        The solution is clear.  We take all sequences of
        rational numbers that converge to <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, throw
        them into our bag and call that <m>\sqrt{2}</m>.
        Our bag is getting pretty full now.
      </p>

      <p>
        But we need to do this without using <m>\sqrt{2}</m> because

            Let <m>0^*</m> be the set of Cauchy sequences in

      </theorem>

      <proof>
        <p>
          From <xref
          ref="prob_CauchyAdditionWellDefined"></xref> it is
          clear that in forming <m>0^*+x</m> we can choose any
          sequence in <m>0^*</m> to represent <m>0^*</m> and any
          sequence in <m>x</m> to represent <m>x</m>.  (This is
          because any other choice will yield a sequence equivalent
          to <m>0^*+x</m>.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus we choose <m>(0, 0, 0, \ldots)</m> to represent
          <m>0^*</m> and any element of <m>x</m>, say <m>(x_1, x_2,
          \ldots)</m>, to represent <m>x</m>.  Then
          <md>
            <mrow>(0, 0, 0, \ldots) + (x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots) \amp = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = x</mrow>
            </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since any other sequences taken from <m>0^*</m> and
          <m>x</m> respectively, will yield a sum equivalent to
          <m>x</m>
          <!-- (see <xref -->

        <p>
          We will not address this issue here, but you should give
          some thought to how this might be accomplished.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        Once the existence of additive and multiplicative inverses
        is established the collection of all sets of equivalent
        Cauchy sequences, with addition and multiplication defined
        as above satisfy all of the field axioms.  It is clear that
        they form a number field and thus deserve to be called
        numbers.
      </p>

      <p>
        However this does not necessarily show that they form
        <m>\RR</m>.  We also need to show that they are complete in
        the sense of <xref ref="IVTandEVT"></xref>.  It is
        perhaps not too surprising that when we build the real
        numbers using equivalent Cauchy sequences the most natural
        completeness property we can show is that if a sequence of
        real numbers is Cauchy then it converges.
      </p>

      <p>
        However we are not in a position to show that Cauchy
        sequences in <m>\RR</m> converge.  To do this we would first
        need to show that these sets of equivalence classes of
        Cauchy sequences (real numbers) are linearly ordered.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately showing the linear ordering, while not
        especially hard, is time consuming.  So we will again invoke
        the prerogatives of the teacher and brush all of the
        difficulties aside with the assertion that it is
        straightforward to show that the real numbers as we have
        constructed them in this section are linearly ordered and
        are complete.  If you would like to see this construction in
        full rigor we recommend the book, <pubtitle>The Number System</pubtitle>
        by H. A. Thurston<xref ref="thurston56__number_system" />.
      </p>
      <aside>
        

        <p>
          Thurston first builds <m>\RR</m> as we<rsq/>ve indicated in
          this section.  Then as a final remark he shows that the
          real numbers must be exactly the infinite decimals we saw
          in the previous section.

      <p>
        An advantage of building the reals via Cauchy sequences in
        the previous section is that once we<rsq/>ve identified
        equivalent sequences with real numbers it is very
        clear how addition and multiplication should be defined.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand, before we can even start to understand
        that construction, we need a fairly strong sense of what it
        means for a sequence to converge and enough experience with
        sequences to be comfortable with the notion of a Cauchy
        sequence.  Thus a good deal of high level mathematics must
        be mastered before we can even begin.

        <idx><h>Dedekind, Richard</h><h>Dedekind cuts</h></idx>

        The method of <q>Dedekind cuts</q> first developed by Richard
        Dedekind (though he just called them <q>cuts</q>) in his 1872
        book, <pubtitle>Continuity and the Irrational Numbers</pubtitle>
        shares the advantage of the Cauchy sequence method in that, once
        the candidates for the real numbers have been identified, it is
        very clear how addition and multiplication should be defined.  It
        is also straightforward to show that most of the field axioms are
        satisfied.

      <p>
        <idx><h>Dedekind, Richard</h></idx>

        In addition, Dedekind<rsq/>s method also has the advantage that
        very little mathematical knowledge is required to get
        started.  This is intentional.  In the preface to the first
        edition of his book, Dedekind states:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          This memoir can be understood by anyone possessing what is
          usually called common sense; no technical philosophic, or
          mathematical, knowledge is in the least degree
          required. (quoted in<nbsp /><xref
          ref="hawking05__god_creat_integ" />)
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        While he may have overstated his case a bit, it is clear
        that his intention was to argue from very simple first
        principles just as Euclid did.
      </p>

      <p>
        His starting point was the observation we made in <xref
        ref="NumbersRealRational"></xref>: The rational
        number line is full of holes.  More precisely we can
        <q>cut</q> the rational line in two distinct ways:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              We can pick a rational number, <m>r</m>.  This choice
              divides all other rational numbers into two classes:
              Those greater than <m>r</m> and those less than
              <m>r</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              We can pick one of the holes in the rational number
              line.  In this case all of the rationals fall
              into two classes: Those greater than the hole and
              those less.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        But to speak of rational numbers as less than or greater
        than something that is not there is utter nonsense.
        We<rsq/>ll need a better (that is, a rigorous) definition.
      </p>

      <p>
        As before we will develop an overall sense of this
        construction rather than a fully detailed presentation, as
        the latter would be far too long to include.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our presentation will closely follow that of Edmund Landau<rsq/>s in
        his classic 1951 text <pubtitle>Foundations of Analysis</pubtitle>
        <xref ref="landau66__found_analy"/>.  We do this so that if you
        choose to pursue this construction in more detail you will be able
        to follow Landau<rsq/>s presentation more easily.

        Because of their intended audiences, Dedekind and Landau
        shied away from using too much notation.  However, we will
        include the following for those who are more comfortable
        with the symbolism as it may help provide more perspective.
        Specifically the properties defining a Dedekind cut
        <m>\alpha</m> can be written as follows.
      </p>
      <p>
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title>Property I</title>
            <p>
              <m>\alpha\ne\emptyset</m> and <m>\QQ^+-\alpha\ne\emptyset</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>Property II</title>
            <p>
              If <m>x\in\alpha</m> and <m>y\in\QQ^+-\alpha</m>, then <m>x\lt y</m>.
              (Alternatively,
              if <m>x\in\alpha</m> and <m>y\lt x</m>, then <m>y\in\alpha</m>.)
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>Property III</title>
            <p>
              If <m>x\in\alpha</m>, then
              <m>\exists\ z\in\alpha</m> such that <m>x\lt z</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </dl>
      </p>
      <p>
        Properties I-III really say that Dedekind cuts are bounded
        open intervals of rational numbers starting at <m>0</m>.
        For example, <m>(0,3)\cap\QQ^+</m> is a Dedekind cut (which
        will eventually be the real number <m>3</m>).  Likewise,
        <m>\left\{x|x^2\lt 2\right\}\cap\QQ^+</m> is a Dedekind cut
        (which will eventually be the real number <m>\sqrt{2}</m>).
        Notice that care must be taken not to actually refer to
        irrational numbers in the properties as the purpose is to
        construct them from rational numbers, but it might help to
        ground you to anticipate what will happen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Take particular notice of the following three facts:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Very little mathematical knowledge is required to
              understand this definition.  We need to know what a
              set is, we need to know what a rational number is, and
              we need to know that given two positive rational
              numbers either they are equal or one is greater.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The language Landau uses is very precise.
              This is necessary in order to avoid such nonsense as
              trying to compare something with nothing like we did a
              couple of paragraphs up.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              We are only using the positive rational
              numbers for our construction.  The reason for this
              will become clear shortly.  As a practical matter for
              now, this means that the cuts we have just defined
              will (eventually) correspond to the positive
              real numbers.

            <m>\beta</m> are cuts then exactly one of the following
            is true:

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>\alpha=\beta</m>.

            </ol>
          </p>
        </statement>
      </problem>

      <p>
        We will need first to define addition and multiplication for
        our cuts and eventually these will need to be extended to
        <m>\RR</m> (once the non-positive reals have also been
        constructed).  It will be necessary to show that the
        extended definitions satisfy the field axioms.  As you can
        see there is a lot to do.

        As we did with Cauchy sequences and with infinite decimals,
        we will stop well short of the full construction.  If you
        are interested in exploring the details of Dedekind<rsq/>s
        construction, Landau<rsq/>s book<nbsp /><xref
        ref="landau66__found_analy" /> is very thorough and was
        written with the explicit intention that it would be
        accessible to students.  In his <q>Preface for the
        Teacher</q> he says
      </p>

      <blockquote>

      <p>
        At this point we have built our cuts and we have defined
        addition and multiplication for cuts.  However, as observed
        earlier the cuts we have will (very soon) correspond only to
        the positive real numbers.  This may appear to be a problem
        but it really isn<rsq/>t because the non-positive real numbers
        can be defined in terms of the positives, that is, in terms
        of our cuts.  We quote from Landau <xref
        ref="landau66__found_analy" />:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          These cuts will henceforth be called the <q>positive
          numbers;</q>  .  .  .
        </p>
        <p>
          We create a new number <m>0</m> (to be read <q>zero</q>),
          distinct from the positive numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also create numbers which are distinct from the
          positive numbers as well as distinct from zero, and which
          we will call negative numbers, in such a way that to each
          <m>\xi</m> (I.e. to each positive number) we assign a
          negative number denoted by <m>-\xi</m> (<m>-</m> to be
          read <q>minus</q>). In this, <m>-\xi</m> and <m>-\nu</m>
          will be considered as the same number (as equal) if and
          only if <m>\xi</m> and <m>\nu</m> are the same number.
        </p>
        <p>
          The totality consisting of all positive numbers, of
          <m>0</m>, and of all negative numbers, will be called the
          real numbers.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Of course it is not nearly enough to simply postulate the
        existence of the non-negative real numbers.
      </p>

      <p>
        All we have so far is a set of objects we<rsq/>re calling the
        real numbers.  For some of them (the positive reals -- that
        is, the cuts) we have defined addition and multiplication.
        These definitions will eventually turn out to correspond to
        the addition and multiplication we are familiar with.
      </p>

      <p>
        However we do not have either operation for our entire set
        of proposed real numbers.  Before we do this we need first
        to define the <term>absolute value</term> of a real number.
        This is a concept you are very familiar with and you have
        probably seen the following definition: Let
        <m>\alpha\in\RR</m>.  Then
        <me>
          \abs{\alpha} = \begin{cases}\alpha\amp  \text{ if \(\alpha\ge0,\) } \\ -\alpha\amp  \text{ if \(\alpha\lt 0.\) } \end{cases}
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately we cannot use this definition because we do
        not yet have a linear ordering on <m>\RR</m> so the
        statement <m>\alpha\ge0</m> is meaningless.  Indeed, it will
        be our definition of absolute value that orders the real
        numbers.  We must be careful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Notice that by definition a negative real number is denoted
        with the dash (<lsq/><m>-</m><rsq/>) in front.   Thus if <m>A</m>
        is any real number then one of the following is
        true:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>A=\chi</m> where  <m>\chi</m> is a cut as defined in <xref ref="def_dedekind-cuts" ></xref>  (<m>A</m> is positive)
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>A=-\chi</m> where  <m>\chi</m> is a cut as defined in <xref ref="def_dedekind-cuts" ></xref> (<m>A</m> is negative)
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>A=0</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        We define absolute value as follows:
      </p>

      <definition xml:id="def_absolute-value">

        <idx><h>Definition</h><h>absolute value of a Dedekind cut</h></idx>
        <idx><h>absolute value of a Dedekind cut</h></idx>

        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>A\in\RR</m> as above.
            Then
            <me>
              \abs{A}= \begin{cases}\chi \amp  \text{ if \(A=\chi{}\)} \\ 0 \amp  \text{ if \(A=0\) } \\ \chi \amp  \text{ if \(A=-\chi{}.\)} {} \end{cases}
            </me>
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>

      <p>
        With this definition in place it is possible to show that
        <m>\RR</m> is linearly ordered.  We will not do this
        explicitly.  Instead we will simply assume that the symbols
        <q><m>\lt</m></q> <q><m>></m>,</q> and <q><m>=</m></q> have
        been defined and have all of the properties we have learned
        to expect from them.
      </p>

      <p>
        We now extend our definitions of addition and multiplication
        from the positive real numbers (cuts) to all of them.
        Curiously, multiplication is the simpler of the two.
      </p>

      <definition xml:id="def_dedekind-multiplication">

        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>\alpha, \beta\in\RR</m>.  Then
            <me>
              \alpha\cdot\beta = \begin{cases}-\abs{\alpha}\abs{\beta}\amp  \text{ if \(\alpha>0,\beta\lt 0\) or \(\alpha\lt 0, \beta>0,\) }  \\ \ \ \,\abs{\alpha}\abs{\beta}\amp  \text{ if \(\alpha\lt 0,\beta\lt 0,\) }  \\ \ \ \ \ \ \, 0\amp  \text{ if \(\alpha=0\) or \(\beta=0.\) }  {} \end{cases}

      </definition>

      <p>
        Notice that the case where <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>
        are both positive was already handled by <xref
        ref="def_dedekind-cuts-multiplication"></xref>
        because in that case they are both cuts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next we define addition.

              </me>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>

      <aside>

        <p>
          Notice also that the fifth case refers to the addition as
          defined in the second case.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        But wait!  In the second and fourth cases of our definition
        we<rsq/>ve actually defined addition in terms of subtraction. But
        we haven<rsq/>t defined subtraction yet!  Oops!
      </p>

      <p>
        This is handled with the definition below, but it
        illuminates very clearly the care that must be taken in
        these constructions.  The real numbers are so
        familiar to us that it is extraordinarily easy to make
        unjustified assumptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the subtractions in the second and fourth cases above
        are done with positive numbers we only need to give meaning
        to the subtraction of cuts.
      </p>

        <idx><h>subtraction of Dedekind cuts</h></idx>

          <p>
            If <m>\alpha</m>, <m>\beta</m> and <m>\delta</m> are
            cuts then the expression
            <me>
              \alpha-\beta=\delta
            </me>
            is defined to mean
            <me>
              \alpha=\delta+\beta
              </me>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>

      <p>
        Of course, there is the detail of showing that there is such a cut
        <m>\delta</m>.  (We warned you of the tediousness of all this.)
        Landau goes through the details of showing that such a cut exists.
        We will present an alternative by defining the cut
        <m>\alpha-\beta</m> directly (assuming <m>\beta\lt \alpha</m>).  To
        motivate this definition, consider something we are familiar with:
        <m>3-2=1</m>.  In terms of cuts, we want to say that the open
        interval from <m>0</m> to <m>3</m> <q>minus</q> the open interval
        from <m>0</m> to <m>2</m> should give us the open interval from
        <m>0</m> to <m>1</m>.  Taking elements from <m>(0,3)</m> and
        subtracting elements from <m>(0,2)</m> won<rsq/>t do it as we would
        have differences such as <m>2.9-.9=2</m> which is not in the cut
        <m>(0,1)</m>.  A moment<rsq/>s thought tells us that what we need to
        do is take all the elements from <m>(0,3)</m> and subtract all the
        elements from <m>(2,\infty)</m>, restricting ourselves only to those
        which are positive rational numbers.  This prompts the following
        definition.

        We will end by saying that no matter how you construct the real
        number system, there is really only one.  More precisely we have
        the following theorem which we state without proof.

        <p>
          In fact, not proving this result seems to be standard in real

        Two linearly ordered number fields are said to be
        isomorphic if there is a one-to-one, onto mapping
        between them (such a mapping is called a bijection)
        which preserves addition, multiplication, and order.
        More precisely, if <m>{\cal F}_1</m> and <m>{\cal
        F}_2</m> are both linearly ordered fields, <m>x, y
        \in{\cal F}_1</m> and <m>\phi:{\cal F}_1\rightarrow{\cal

        Remember that we warned you that these constructions
        were fraught with technical details that are not
        necessarily illuminating.  Nonetheless, at this point,
        you have everything you need to show that the set of all
        real numbers as defined above is linearly ordered and
        satisfies the Least Upper Bound property.

        But we will stop here in order, to paraphrase Descartes,
        to leave for you the joy of further discovery.
