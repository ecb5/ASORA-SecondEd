    <title>Epilog #1: On the Nature of Numbers: A Dialogue (with Apologies to
    Galileo)</title>

    <p>
      <alert>Interlocuters</alert>: <em>Salviati, Sagredo,
      and Simplicio; Three Friends of Galileo Galilei</em>
    </p>
    <p> <alert>Setting</alert>: Three friends meet in a garden for
    lunch in Renaissance Italy.  Prior to their meal they discuss
    the book
    <pubtitle>
      A Contextual Introduction to Real Analysis: How We Got From There To Here
    </pubtitle>
    .
    How they obtained a copy is not clear.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>: My good sirs.
      I have read this very strange volume as I hope you have?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>: I have and I also found it very strange.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>: Very strange indeed;
      at once silly and mystifying.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>: Silly?
      How so?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>:
      These authors begin their tome with the question,
      <q>What is a number?</q> This is an unusually silly question,
      don<rsq/>t you think?
      Numbers are numbers.
      Everyone knows what they are.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>: I thought so as well until I reached the
      last chapter.  But now I am not so certain.  What about this
      quantity <m>\aleph_0?</m> If this counts the positive integers,
      isn<rsq/>t it a number?  If not, then how can it count anything?
      If so, then what number is it?  These questions plague me
      <lsq/>til I scarcely believe I know anything anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>: Of course <m>\aleph_0</m> is not a number!
      It is simply a new name for the infinite,
      and infinity is not a number.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>: But isn<rsq/>t
      <m>\aleph_0</m> the cardinality of the set of natural numbers,
      <m>\NN</m>,
      in just the same way that the cardinality of the set
      <m>S=\left\{Salviati, Sagredo, Simplicio\right\}</m> is <m>3?</m> If <m>3</m> is a number,
      then why isn<rsq/>t <m>\aleph_0?</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>: Ah, my friend,
      like our authors you are simply playing with words.
      You count the elements in the set
      <m>S=\left\{Salviati, Sagredo, Simplicio\right\};</m> you see plainly that the
      number of elements
      it contains is <m>3</m> and then you change your language.
      Rather than saying that the number of elements
      in <m>S</m> is <m>3</m> you say that the
      <term>cardinality</term> is <m>3</m>.
      But clearly <q>cardinality</q>
      and <q>number of elements</q> mean the same thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly you use the symbol <m>\NN</m> to denote the set of positive integers.
      With your new word and symbol you make the statement
      <q>the <term>cardinality</term>
      (number of elements)
      of <m>\NN</m> is <m>\aleph_0</m>.</q>
      This statement has the same grammatical form as the statement <q>the
      number of elements
      (cardinality) of <m>S</m> is three.</q> Since three is
      a number you conclude that <m>\aleph_0</m> is also a number.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this is simply nonsense dressed up to sound sensible.
      If we unwind our notation and language, your statement is simply,
      <q>The number of positive integers is infinite.</q>
      This is obviously nonsense because infinity is not a number.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if we take infinity as an undefined term and try to define it by your statement this is still nonsense since you are using the word <q>number</q>
      to define a new <q>number</q> called infinity.
      This definition is circular.
      Thus it is no definition at all.
      It is nonsense.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>: Your reasoning on this certainly seems sound.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>: Thank you.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>:  However,
      there are a couple of small points I would like to examine more closely if you will indulge me?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>: Of course.
      What troubles you?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Salviati</alert>: You<rsq/>ve said that we cannot use the word <q>number</q>
      to define numbers because this would be circular reasoning.
      I entirely agree,
      but I am not sure this is what our authors are doing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider the set <m>\left\{1, 2, 3\right\}</m>.
      Do you agree that it contains three elements?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Simplicio</alert>: Obviously.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Sagredo</alert>: Ah!  I see your point!  That there are
      three elements does not depend on what those elements
      are.  Any set with three elements has three elements
      regardless of the nature of the elements.  Thus saying that
      the set <m>\left\{1, 2, 3\right\}</m> contains three elements
      does not define the word <q>number</q> in a circular manner
      because it is irrelevant that the number 3 is one of
      the elements of the set.  Thus to say that three is the
      cardinality of the set <m>\left\{1, 2, 3\right\}</m> has the
      same meaning as saying that there are three elements in the
      set <m>\left\{Salviati, Sagredo, Simplicio\right\}</m>.  In
      both cases the number <q><m>3</m></q> is the name that we give
      to the totality of the elements of each set.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Salviati</alert>:  Precisely.
  In exactly the same way <m>\aleph_0</m> is the symbol we use to denote the totality of the set of positive integers.
</p>

<p>
  Thus <m>\aleph_0</m> is a number in the same sense that <sq><m>3</m></sq> is a number,
  is it not?
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  I see that we can say in a meaningful way that three is the cardinality of any set with<nbsp />.<nbsp />.<nbsp />.<nbsp />well,<nbsp />.<nbsp />.<nbsp />.<nbsp />with three elements
  (it becomes very difficult to talk about these things)
  but this is simply a tautology!
  It is a way of saying that a set which has three elements has three elements!
</p>

<p>
  This means only that we have counted them and we had to stop at three.
  In order to do this we must have numbers first.
  Which, of course, we do.
  As I said, everyone knows what numbers are.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  I must confess,
  my friend, that I become more confused as we speak.
  I am no longer certain that I really know what a number is.
  Since you seem to have retained your certainty can you clear this up for me?
  Can you tell me what a number is?
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  Certainly.
  A number is what we have just been discussing.
  It is what you have when you stop counting.
  For example, three is the totality
  (to use your phrase)
  of the elements of the sets <m>\left\{Salviati, Sagredo, Simplicio\right\}</m> or
  <m>\left\{1, 2, 3\right\}</m> because when I count the elements in either set I have to stop at three.
  Nothing less, nothing more.
  Thus three is a number.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Salviati</alert>:  But this definition only confuses me!
  Surely you will allow that fractions are numbers?
  What is counted when we end with,
say <m>4/5</m> or <m>1/5?</m>
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Simplicio</alert>: This is simplicity itself.  <m>4/5</m> is
  the number we get when we have divided something into <m>5</m> equal
  pieces and we have counted four of these fifths.  This is
  four<ndash/>fifths.  You see?  Even the language we use naturally
  bends itself to our purpose.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Salviati</alert>:  But what of one-fifth?
  In order to count one fifth we must first divide something into fifths.
  To do this we must know what one-fifth is, musn<rsq/>t we?
  We seem to be using the word <q>number</q> to define itself again.
  Have we not come full circle and gotten nowhere?
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  I confess this had not occurred to me before.
  But your objection is easily answered.
  To count one-fifth we simply divide our
  <q>something</q> into tenths.
  Then we count two of them.
  Since two-tenths is the same as one-fifth the problem is solved.
  Do you see?
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  I see your point but it will not suffice at all!
  It merely replaces the question,
  <q>What is one-fifth?</q> with,
  <q>What is one-tenth?</q> Nor will it do to say that one-tenth is merely two-twentieths.
  This simply shifts the question back another level.
</p>

<p>
  Archimedes said,
<q>Give me a place to stand and a lever long enough and I will move the earth.</q>
But of course he never moved the earth because he had nowhere to stand.
We seem to find ourselves in Archimedes<rsq/> predicament: We have no place to stand.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  I confess I don<rsq/>t see a way to answer this right now.
  However I<rsq/>m sure an answer can be found if we only think hard enough.
  In the meantime I cannot accept that <m>\aleph_0</m> is a number.
  It is, as I said before, infinity and infinity is not a number!
  We may as well believe in fairies and leprechauns if we call infinity a number.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  But again we<rsq/>ve come full circle.
  We cannot say definitively that
  <m>\aleph_0</m> is or is not a number until we can state with confidence what a number is.
  And even if we could find solid ground on which to solve the problem of fractions,
  what of <m>\sqrt{2}?</m> Or <m>\pi?</m> Certainly these are numbers but I see no way to count to either of them.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  Alas!
  I am beset by demons!
  I am bewitched!
  I no longer believe what I know to be true!
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Salviati</alert>:  Perhaps things are not quite as bad as that.
  Let us consider further.
  You said earlier that we all know what numbers are, and I agree.
  But perhaps your statement needs to be more precisely formulated.
  Suppose we say instead that we all know what numbers need to be?
  Or that we know what we want numbers to be?
</p>

<p>
Even if we cannot say with certainly what numbers are
surely we can say what we want and need for them to be.
Do you agree?
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  I do.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  And so do I.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Salviati</alert>:  Then let us invent numbers anew,
  as if we<rsq/>ve never seen them before,
  always keeping in mind those properties we need for numbers to have.
  If we take this as a starting point then the question we need to address is,
<q>What do we need numbers to be?</q>
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  This is obvious!
  We need to be able to add them and we need to be able to multiply them together,
  and the result should also be a number.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  And subtract and divide too, of course.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  I am not so sure we actually need these.
Could we not define <q>subtract two from three</q>
to be <q>add negative two to three</q>
and thus dispense with subtraction and division?
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  I suppose we can but I see no advantage in doing so.
  Why not simply have subtraction and division as we<rsq/>ve always known them?
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  The advantage is parsimony.
  Two arithmetic operations are easier to keep track of than four.
  I suggest we go forward with only addition and multiplication for now.
  If we find we need subtraction or division we can consider them later.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  Agreed.
  And I now see another advantage.
  Obviously addition and multiplication must not depend on order.
  That is, if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are numbers then <m>x+y</m> must be equal to <m>y+x</m> and <m>xy</m> must be equal to <m>yx</m>.
  This is not true for subtraction,
  for <m>3-2</m> does not equal <m>2-3</m>.
  But if we define subtraction as you suggest then this symmetry is preserved:
  <me>
    x+(-y) = (-y)+x
    </me>.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  Excellent!
  Another property we will require of numbers occurs to me now.
  When adding or multiplying more than two numbers it should not matter where we begin.
  That is, if <m>x</m>,
  <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> are numbers it should be true that
  <me>
    (x+y)+z = x+(y+z)
</me>
and
<me>
  (x\cdot y)\cdot z = x\cdot(y\cdot z)
  </me>.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  Yes!
  We have it!
  Any objects which combine in these precise ways can be called numbers.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Salviati</alert>:  Certainly these properties are necessary,
  but I don<rsq/>t think they are yet sufficient to our purpose.
  For example,
  the number <m>1</m> is unique in that it is the only number which,
  when multiplying another number leaves it unchanged.
</p>

<p>
  For example:  <m>1\cdot3=3</m>.
  Or, in general, if <m>x</m> is a number then <m>1\cdot x =x</m>.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  Yes.
  Indeed.
  It occurs to me that the number zero plays a similar role for addition:
  <m>0+x=x</m>.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Salviati</alert>:  It does not seem to me that addition and multiplication,
  as we have defined them,
  force <m>1</m> or <m>0</m> into existence so I believe we will have to postulate their existence independently.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  Is this everything then?
  Is this all we require of numbers?
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  I don<rsq/>t think we are quite done yet.
  How shall we get division?
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Sagredo</alert>: In the same way that we defined subtraction
  to be the addition of a negative number, can we not define division
  to be multiplication by a reciprocal?  For example, <m>3</m> divided
  by <m>2</m> can be considered <m>3</m> multiplied by <m>1/2</m>, can
  it not?
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Salviati</alert>: I think it can.  But observe that every
  number will need to have a corresponding negative so that we can
  subtract any amount.  And again nothing we<rsq/>ve discussed so far
  forces these negative numbers into existence so we will have to
  postulate their existence separately.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  And in the same way every number will need a reciprocal so that we can divide by any amount.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  Every number that is, except zero.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  Yes, this is true.
  Strange is it not,
  that of them all only this one number needs no reciprocal?
  Shall we also postulate that zero has no reciprocal?
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Salviati</alert>: I don<rsq/>t see why we should.
  Possibly <m>\aleph_0</m> is the reciprocal of zero.
  Or possibly not.
  But I see no need to concern ourselves with things we do not need.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Simplicio</alert>: Is this everything then?
  Have we discovered all that we need for numbers to be?
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Salviati</alert>: I believe there is only one property missing.
  We have postulated addition and we have postulated multiplication and we have described the numbers zero and one which play similar roles for addition and multiplication respectively.
  But we have not described how addition and multiplication work together.
</p>

<p>
  That is, we need a rule of distribution:  If <m>x</m>,
  <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> are all numbers then
  <me>
    x\cdot(y+z) = x\cdot y+x\cdot z
    </me>.
</p>

<p>
  With this in place I believe we have everything we need.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  Indeed.
  We can also see from this that
  <m>\aleph_0</m> cannot be a number since,
  in the first place,
  it cannot be added to another number and in the second,
  even if it could be added to a number the result is surely not also a number.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Salviati</alert>:  My dear Simplicio, I fear you have missed the point entirely!
  Our axioms do not declare what a number is,
  only how it behaves with respect to addition and multiplication with other numbers.
Thus it is a mistake to presume that <q>numbers</q>
are only those objects that we have always believed them to be.
In fact, it now occurs to me that
<q>addition</q> and <q>multiplication</q>
also needn<rsq/>t be seen as the operations we have always believed them to be.
</p>

<p>
  For example suppose we have three objects,
<m>\left\{a, b, c\right\}</m> and suppose that we define <q>addition</q>
and <q>multiplication</q> by the following tables:
<md>
  <mrow>
    \begin{array}{c|ccc}
    +\amp a\amp b\amp c\\\hline
    a\amp a\amp b\amp c\\
    b\amp b\amp c\amp a\\
    c\amp c\amp a\amp b
    \end{array}
    \amp \amp \amp \amp \amp \amp
    \begin{array}{c|ccc}
    \cdot\amp a\amp b\amp c\\\hline
    a\amp a\amp a\amp a\\
    b\amp a\amp b\amp c\\
    c\amp a\amp c\amp b
    \end{array}
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>
  I submit that our set along with these definitions satisfy all of our axioms and thus <m>a</m>,
<m>b</m> and <m>c</m> qualify to be called <q>numbers.</q>
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Simplicio</alert>:  This cannot be!
  There is no zero, no one!
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Sagredo</alert>:  But there is.
  Do you not see that <m>a</m> plays the role of zero <mdash /> if you add it to any number you get that number back.
  Similarly <m>b</m> plays the role of one.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Simplicio</alert>: This is astonishing!  If <m>a, b</m> and
  <m>c</m> can be numbers then I am less sure than ever that I know
  what numbers are!  Why, if we replace <m>a, b</m>, and <m>c</m> with
  <em>Simplicio</em> <em>Sagredo,</em> and <em>Salviati</em> then
  we become numbers ourselves!
</p>

<p>
  <alert>Salviati</alert>: Perhaps we will have to be content with
  knowing how numbers behave rather than knowing what they are.
</p>

<p>
  However I confess that I have a certain affection for the numbers I grew up with.
  Let us call those the <q>real</q> numbers.
  Any other set of numbers,
  such as our <m>\left\{a,b,c\right\}</m> above we will call a field of numbers,
  since they seem to provide us with new ground to explore.
  Or perhaps just a <term>number field</term>?
</p>

<p>
  As we have been discussing this I have been writing down our
  axioms.  They are these.  Numbers are any objects which satisfy
  all of the following properties:

<section xml:id="SECTIONBuildReals">
  <title> Epilog #2: Building the Real Numbers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Contrary to the title of this section we will not be rigorously
      building the real numbers here.  Instead our goal is to show why
      such a build is logically necessary, and to give a sense of some
      of the ways this has been accomplished in the past.  This may
      seem odd given our uniform emphasis on mathematical rigor,
      especially in the third part of the text, but there are very
      good reasons for this.
    </p>

    <p>
      One is simple practicality.  The fact is that rigorously
      building the real numbers and then showing that they have
      the required properties is extraordinarily detailed work,
      even for mathematics.  If we want to keep this text to a
      manageable size (we do), we simply don<rsq/>t have the room.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second reason is that there is, as far as we know, very
      little for you to gain by it.  When we are done we will have the
      real numbers.  The same real numbers you have been using all of
      your life.  They have the same properties, and quirks, they<rsq/>ve
      always had.  To be sure, they will not have lost any of their
      charm. They will be the same delightful mix of the mundane and
      the bizarre, and they are still well worth exploring and getting
      to know better.  But nothing we do in the course of building
      them up logically from simpler ideas will help with that
      exploration.
    </p>

    <p>
      A reasonable question then, is,
      <q>Why bother?</q> If the process is overwhelmingly, tediously detailed
      (it is)
      and gives us nothing new for our efforts, why do it at all?
    </p>

      <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wiles/" visual="mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wiles/">Andrew Wiles</url> has compared
      doing mathematics to entering a dark room. At
      first you are lost.  The layout of the room and furniture are
      unknown so you fumble about for a bit and slowly get a sense of
      your immediate environs, perhaps a vague notion of the
      organization of the room as a whole.  Eventually, after much,
      often tedious exploration, you become quite comfortable in your
      room.  But always there will be dark corners; hidden areas you
      have not yet explored.  Such a dark area may hide anything; the
      latches to unopened doors you didn<rsq/>t know were there; a clamp
      whose presence explains why you couldn<rsq/>t move that little desk
      in the corner; even the light switch that would allow you to
      illuminate an area more clearly than you would have imagined
      possible.

      <p>
        But, and this is the point, there is no way to know what you
        will find there until you walk into that dark corner and begin
        exploring.  Perhaps nothing.  But perhaps something wonderful.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is what happened in the late nineteenth century.  The real
        numbers had been used since the Pythagoreans learned that
        <m>\sqrt{2}</m> was irrational.  But really, most calculations
        were (and still are) done with just the rational numbers.
        Moreover, since <m>\QQ</m> forms a <q>set of measure
        zero,</q>
        <idx><h>measure zero</h></idx>
        it is clear that most of the real numbers had gone completely unused.
        The set of real numbers was thus one of those
        <q>dark corners</q> of mathematics.
        It had to be explored.

      <p>
        <q>But even if that is true,</q> you might ask, <q>I have
        no interest in the logical foundations of the real
        numbers, especially if such knowledge won<rsq/>t tell me
        anything I don<rsq/>t already know.  Why do I need to know all
        of the details of constructing <m>\RR</m> from
        <m>\QQ?</m></q>
      </p>

      <p>
        The answer to this is very simple: You don<rsq/>t.
      </p>

      <p>
        That<rsq/>s the other reason we're not covering all of the
        details of this material.  We will explain enough to light
        up, dimly perhaps, this little corner of mathematics.
        Later, should you need (or want) to come back to this and
        explore further you will have a foundation to start with.
        Nothing more.  </p> <p> Until the nineteenth century the
        geometry of Euclid, as given in his book <pubtitle>The
        Elements,</pubtitle> was universally regarded as the touchstone
        of mathematical perfection.  This belief was so deeply
        embedded in Western culture that as recently as 1923, Edna
        St. Vincent Millay opened one of the poems in her
        book <pubtitle>The Harp Weaver and Other Poems</pubtitle> with the
        line <q>Euclid alone has looked on beauty bare.</q>
      </p>

      <p>
        Euclid begins his book by stating <m>5</m> <term>Common
        Notions</term> (essentially some elementary rules of logic)
        and <m>5</m> simple geometric <term>Axioms</term> and
        proceeds, step by logical step, to build up his geometry.
        Although far from actual perfection, his methods are clean,
        precise and efficient <mdash /> he arrives at the Pythagorean
        Theorem in only <m>47</m> steps (theorems) <mdash /> and even
        today Euclid<rsq/>s <pubtitle>The Elements</pubtitle> still sets a
        very high standard of mathematical exposition and parsimony.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of starting with what is clear and simple and
        proceeding logically, rigorously, to what is complex is
        still a guiding principle of all mathematics for a variety
        of reasons.  In the late nineteenth century, this principle
        was brought to bear on the real numbers.  That is, some
        properties of the real numbers that at first seem simple and
        intuitively clear turn out on closer examination, as we have
        seen, to be rather counter-intuitive.  This alone is not
        really a problem.  We can have counter-intuitive properties
        in our mathematics <mdash /> indeed, this is a big part of
        what makes mathematics interesting <mdash /> as long as we
        arrive at them logically, starting from simple assumptions
        the same way Euclid did.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having arrived at a view of the real numbers which is comparable to that of our nineteenth century colleagues,
        it should now be clear that the real numbers and their properties must be built up from simpler concepts as suggested by our Italian friends in the previous section.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to those properties we have discovered so far,
        both <m>\QQ</m> and <m>\RR</m> share another property which will be useful.
        We have used it throughout this text but have not heretofore made it explicit.
        They are both <term>linearly ordered</term>.
        We will now make this property explicit.

<p>
  In a thorough, rigorous presentation we would now assume the
  existence of the natural numbers <m>(\NN)</m>, and their
  properties and use these to define the integers,
  <m>(\ZZ)</m>.  We would then use the integers to define the
  rational numbers, <m>(\QQ)</m>.  We could then show that the
  rationals satisfy the field axioms worked out in the
  previous section, and that they are linearly ordered.
</p>

<p>
  Then <mdash /> at last <mdash /> we would use <m>\QQ</m> to
  define the real numbers <m>(\RR)</m>, show that these
  satisfy the field axioms and also have the other properties
  we expect:  The <xref ref="NIP" text="custom">Nested Interval Property</xref> , the
  <xref ref="def_LeastUpperBound" text="custom">Least Upper Bound Property</xref>, the <xref ref="BolzanoWeierstrass" text="custom">Bolzano<ndash/>Weierstrass Theorem</xref>,
  the <xref ref="thm_Cauchy-_Converge" text="custom">convergence of all Cauchy sequences</xref>, and <xref ref="def_NumberField" text="custom">linear
  ordering</xref>.
</p>

<p>
  We would start with the natural numbers because they seem to
  be simple enough that we can simply assume their properties.
  As <url
  href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Kronecker/"
  visual="mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Kronecker/">
  Leopold Kronecker</url> (1823-1891) said: <q>God made the
natural numbers, all else is the work of man.</q>
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately this is rather a lot to fit into this epilog
  so we will have to abbreviate the process rather severely.
</p>
<p>
  We will assume the existence and properties of the rational
  numbers.  Building <m>\QQ</m> from the integers is not
  especially hard and it is easy to show that they satisfy the
  axioms worked out by Salviati, Sagredo and Simplicio in the
  previous section.  But the level of detail required for rigor
  quickly becomes onerous.
</p>

<p>
  Even starting at this fairly advanced position in the chain
  of logic there is still a considerable level of detail
  needed to complete the process.  Therefore our exposition
  will necessarily be incomplete.
</p>

<p>
  Rather than display, in full rigor, how the real numbers can
  be built up from the rationals we will show, in fairly broad
  terms, three ways this has been done in the past.  We will
  give references later in case you<rsq/>d like to follow up and
  learn more.
</p>
</introduction>

<subsection xml:id="DecimalExpansion">
  <title>The Decimal Expansion</title>
  <p>
    This is by far the most straightforward method we will
    examine.  Observe that if <m>x\in\QQ</m> then expressing
    <m>x</m> as a decimal gives a <term>repeating infinite
    decimal</term>. For example <m>\frac{1}{4}=0.25000\ldots{}</m>
    where zero is repeated and <m>\frac13 =0.333\ldots{}</m>
    where three is repeated.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before going further there is a small detail that needs to be
    addressed. Since <m>1.000\ldots=0.999\ldots{}</m> we see that there are two
    ways to represent <m>1</m> as a repeating decimal. In fact any decimal
    that eventually repeats <m>9</m> will have two possible decimal
    representations, one with repeating zeros and the other with
    repeating nines. For full rigor we need to systematically choose one
    or the other. It doesn<rsq/>t matter which.
  </p>


  <p>
    We would like to define <m>\QQ</m> to be the set of all
    decimal expressions which eventually repeat,    If it
    eventually repeats zeros or nines then it is what we<rsq/>ve
    called a finite decimal.
  </p>


  <p>
    We then define the real numbers to be the set of all
    infinite decimals, repeating or not.
  </p>

  <p>
    It may feel as if all we have to do is define addition and
    multiplication in the obvious fashion and we are finished.
    This set with these definitions obviously satisfy all of the
    field axioms worked out by our Italian friends in the
    previous section.  Moreover it seems clear that all of our
    equivalent completeness axioms are satisfied.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, things are not quite as clear cut as they seem.
  </p>

  <p>
    The primary difficulty in this approach is that the decimal
    representation of the real numbers is so familiar that
    everything we need to show seems obvious.  But stop
    and think for a moment.  Is it really obvious how to define
    addition and multiplication of infinite decimals?
    Consider the addition algorithm we were all taught in grade
    school.  That algorithm requires that we line up two numbers
    at their decimal points:
    <md>
      <mrow>d_1d_2\amp .d_3d_4</mrow>
      <mrow>+\   \delta_1\delta_2\amp .\delta_3\delta_4</mrow>
      </md>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We then begin adding in the rightmost column and proceed to
    the left.  But if our decimals are infinite we can<rsq/>t get
    started because there is no rightmost column!
  </p>

  <p>
    A similar problem occurs with multiplication.
  </p>

  <p>
    So our first problem is to define addition and
    multiplication in <m>\RR</m> in a manner that re-captures
    addition and multiplication in <m>\QQ</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not a trivial task.
  </p>

  <p>
    One way to proceed is to recognize that the decimal notation
    we<rsq/>ve used all of our lives is really shorthand for the sum
    of an infinite series.  That is, if
    <m>x=0.d_1d_2d_3\ldots</m> where <m>0\leq d_i\leq 9</m> for
    all <m>i\in\NN</m> then
    <me>
      x=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{d_i}{10^i}
      </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Addition is now apparently easy to define: If
    <m>x=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{d_i}{10^i}</m> and <m>y=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{\delta_i}{10^i}</m> then
    <me>
      x+y= \sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{e_i}{10^i} \text{ where \(e_i =d_i+\delta_i\). }
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    But there is a problem.  Suppose for some <m>j\in\NN</m>,
    <m>e_j=d_j+\delta_j>10</m>.  In that case our sum does not
    satisfy the condition <m>0\leq e_j\leq 9</m> so it is not
    even clear that the expression
    <m>\sum_{j=1}^\infty\frac{e_j}{10^j}</m> represents a real
    number.  That is, we may not have the closure property of a
    number field.  We will have to define some sort of
    <q>carrying</q> operation to handle this.
  </p>

  <problem>
    <idx><h><m>\RR</m></h><h>defining infinite decimal addition</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Define addition on infinite decimals in a manner that is closed.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        Find an appropriate <q>carry</q> operation for our definition.
      </p>
    </hint>
  </problem>

  <p>
    A similar difficulty arises when we try to define
    multiplication.  Once we have a notion of carrying in place,
    we could define multiplication as just the multiplication of
    series.  Specifically, we could define
    <md>
      <mrow>(0.a_1a_2a_3\ldots)\cdot(0.b_1b_2b_3\ldots) \amp =\left(\frac{a_1}{10}+\frac{a_2}{10^2}+\cdots\right) \cdot\left(\frac{b_1}{10}+\frac{b_2}{10^2}+\cdots\right)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp =\frac{a_1b_1}{10^2}+\frac{a_1b_2+a_2b_1}{10^3}+\frac{a_1b_3+a_2b_2+a_3b_1}{10^4}+\cdots</mrow>
      </md>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We could then convert this to a <q>proper</q> decimal using
    our carrying operation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Again the devil is in the details to show that such
    algebraic operations satisfy everything we want them to.
    Even then, we need to worry about linearly ordering these
    numbers and our completeness axiom.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another way of looking at this is to think of an infinite
    decimal representation as a (Cauchy) sequence of finite
    decimal approximations.  Since we know how to add and
    multiply finite decimal representations, we can just add and
    multiply the individual terms in the sequences.  Of course,
    there is no reason to restrict ourselves to only these
    specific types of Cauchy sequences, as we see in our next
    approach.

  <title>Cauchy Sequences</title>
  <p>
    <idx><h>Cantor, Georg</h></idx>

    As we<rsq/>ve seen, Georg Cantor began his career studying
    Fourier series and quickly moved on to more foundational
    matters in the theory of infinite sets.
  </p>

  <p>
    But he did not lose his fascination with real analysis when
    he moved on.  Like many mathematicians of his time, he
    realized the need to build <m>\RR</m> from <m>\QQ</m>.  He
    and his friend and mentor Richard Dedekind <idx><h>Dedekind,
    Richard</h></idx> (who<rsq/>s approach we will see in the next
    section) both found different ways to build <m>\RR</m> from
    <m>\QQ</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cantor started with Cauchy sequences in <m>\QQ</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    That is, we consider the set of all Cauchy sequences of
    rational numbers.  We would like to define each
    such sequence to be a real number.  The goal should be
    clear.  If <m>\left(s_n\right)_{n=1}^\infty</m> is a
    sequence in <m>\QQ</m> which converges to <m>\sqrt{2}</m>
    then we will call <m>\left(s_n\right)</m> the real number
    <m>\sqrt{2}</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This probably seems a bit startling at first.  There are a lot of
    numbers in <m>\left(s_n\right)</m> (countably infinitely many, to
    be precise) and we are proposing putting all of them into a big
    bag, tying it up in a ribbon, and calling the whole thing
    <m>\sqrt{2}</m>.  It seems a very odd thing to propose, but recall
    from the discussion in the previous section that we left the
    concept of <q>number</q> undefined.  Thus if we can take any set
    of objects and define addition and multiplication in such a way
    that the field axioms are satisfied, then those objects are
    legitimately numbers.  To show that they are, in fact, the
    <term>real numbers</term> <m>\left(\RR\right)</m> we will also
    need the completeness property.
  </p>

  <p>
    A bag full of rational numbers works as well as anything
    if we can define addition and multiplication
    appropriately.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our immediate problem though is not addition or
    multiplication but uniqueness.  If we take one sequence
    <m>\left(s_n\right)</m> which converges to <m>\sqrt{2}</m>
    and define it to be <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, what will we do with
    all of the other sequences that converge to <m>\sqrt{2}?</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, we have to be careful not to refer to any real numbers, like
    the square root of two for example, as we define the real numbers.
    This would be a circular <mdash /> and thus useless <mdash />
    definition.  Obviously though, we can refer to <term>rational
    numbers</term> <m>\left(\QQ\right) </m>, since these are the tools
    we<rsq/>ll be using.
  </p>

  <p>
    The solution is clear.  We take all sequences of
    rational numbers that converge to <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, throw
    them into our bag and call that <m>\sqrt{2}</m>.
    Our bag is getting pretty full now.
  </p>

  <p>
    But we need to do this without using <m>\sqrt{2}</m> because
    it is a real number.  The following two definitions satisfy
    all of our needs.

    <m>(s_n+\sigma_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m>
    (<m>(s_n\sigma_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m>) and then show that all
    such sums (products) are equivalent.  Otherwise addition
    (multiplication) is not well-defined: It would depend on

  <proof>
    <p>
      From <xref
      ref="prob_CauchyAdditionWellDefined"></xref> it is
      clear that in forming <m>0^*+x</m> we can choose any
      sequence in <m>0^*</m> to represent <m>0^*</m> and any
      sequence in <m>x</m> to represent <m>x</m>.  (This is
      because any other choice will yield a sequence equivalent
      to <m>0^*+x</m>.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus we choose <m>(0, 0, 0, \ldots)</m> to represent
      <m>0^*</m> and any element of <m>x</m>, say <m>(x_1, x_2,
      \ldots)</m>, to represent <m>x</m>.  Then
      <md>
        <mrow>(0, 0, 0, \ldots) + (x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots) \amp = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = x</mrow>
        </md>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since any other sequences taken from <m>0^*</m> and

      <m>x</m>
      <!-- (see <xref -->

  <p>
    Once the existence of additive and multiplicative inverses
    is established the collection of all sets of equivalent
    Cauchy sequences, with addition and multiplication defined
    as above satisfy all of the field axioms.  It is clear that
    they form a number field and thus deserve to be called
    numbers.
  </p>

  <p>
    However this does not necessarily show that they form
    <m>\RR</m>.  We also need to show that they are complete in
    the sense of <xref ref="IVTandEVT"></xref>.  It is
    perhaps not too surprising that when we build the real
    numbers using equivalent Cauchy sequences the most natural
    completeness property we can show is that if a sequence of
    real numbers is Cauchy then it converges.
  </p>

  <p>
    However we are not in a position to show that Cauchy
    sequences in <m>\RR</m> converge.  To do this we would first
    need to show that these sets of equivalence classes of
    Cauchy sequences (real numbers) are linearly ordered.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unfortunately showing the linear ordering, while not
    especially hard, is time consuming.  So we will again invoke
    the prerogatives of the teacher and brush all of the
    difficulties aside with the assertion that it is
    straightforward to show that the real numbers as we have
    constructed them in this section are linearly ordered and
    are complete.  If you would like to see this construction in
    full rigor we recommend the book, <pubtitle>The Number System</pubtitle>
    by H. A. Thurston<xref ref="thurston56__number_system" />.
  </p>
  <aside>
    

    <p>
      Thurston first builds <m>\RR</m> as we<rsq/>ve indicated in
      this section.  Then as a final remark he shows that the
      real numbers must be exactly the infinite decimals we saw
      in the previous section.

  <p>
    On the other hand, before we can even start to understand

    In addition, Dedekind<rsq/>s method also has the advantage that
    very little mathematical knowledge is required to get
    started.  This is intentional.  In the preface to the first
    edition of his book, Dedekind states:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      This memoir can be understood by anyone possessing what is
      usually called common sense; no technical philosophic, or
      mathematical, knowledge is in the least degree
      required. (quoted in<nbsp /><xref
      ref="hawking05__god_creat_integ" />)
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    While he may have overstated his case a bit, it is clear
    that his intention was to argue from very simple first
    principles just as Euclid did.
  </p>

  <p>
    His starting point was the observation we made in <xref
    ref="NumbersRealRational"></xref>: The rational
    number line is full of holes.  More precisely we can
    <q>cut</q> the rational line in two distinct ways:

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          We can pick a rational number, <m>r</m>.  This choice
          divides all other rational numbers into two classes:
          Those greater than <m>r</m> and those less than
          <m>r</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          We can pick one of the holes in the rational number
          line.  In this case all of the rationals fall
          into two classes: Those greater than the hole and
          those less.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    But to speak of rational numbers as less than or greater
    than something that is not there is utter nonsense.
    We<rsq/>ll need a better (that is, a rigorous) definition.
  </p>

  <p>
    As before we will develop an overall sense of this
    construction rather than a fully detailed presentation, as
    the latter would be far too long to include.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our presentation will closely follow that of Edmund Landau<rsq/>s in
    his classic 1951 text <pubtitle>Foundations of Analysis</pubtitle>
    <xref ref="landau66__found_analy"/>.  We do this so that if you
    choose to pursue this construction in more detail you will be able
    to follow Landau<rsq/>s presentation more easily.

    Because of their intended audiences, Dedekind and Landau
    shied away from using too much notation.  However, we will
    include the following for those who are more comfortable
    with the symbolism as it may help provide more perspective.
    Specifically the properties defining a Dedekind cut
    <m>\alpha</m> can be written as follows.
  </p>
  <p>
    <dl>
      <li>
        <title>Property I</title>
        <p>
          <m>\alpha\ne\emptyset</m> and <m>\QQ^+-\alpha\ne\emptyset</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <title>Property II</title>
        <p>
          If <m>x\in\alpha</m> and <m>y\in\QQ^+-\alpha</m>, then <m>x\lt y</m>.
          (Alternatively,
          if <m>x\in\alpha</m> and <m>y\lt x</m>, then <m>y\in\alpha</m>.)
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <title>Property III</title>
        <p>
          If <m>x\in\alpha</m>, then
          <m>\exists\ z\in\alpha</m> such that <m>x\lt z</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </dl>
  </p>
  <p>
    Properties I-III really say that Dedekind cuts are bounded
    open intervals of rational numbers starting at <m>0</m>.
    For example, <m>(0,3)\cap\QQ^+</m> is a Dedekind cut (which
    will eventually be the real number <m>3</m>).  Likewise,
    <m>\left\{x|x^2\lt 2\right\}\cap\QQ^+</m> is a Dedekind cut
    (which will eventually be the real number <m>\sqrt{2}</m>).
    Notice that care must be taken not to actually refer to
    irrational numbers in the properties as the purpose is to
    construct them from rational numbers, but it might help to
    ground you to anticipate what will happen.
  </p>

  <p>
    Take particular notice of the following three facts:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Very little mathematical knowledge is required to
          understand this definition.  We need to know what a
          set is, we need to know what a rational number is, and
          we need to know that given two positive rational
          numbers either they are equal or one is greater.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The language Landau uses is very precise.
          This is necessary in order to avoid such nonsense as
          trying to compare something with nothing like we did a
          couple of paragraphs up.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          We are only using the positive rational
          numbers for our construction.  The reason for this
          will become clear shortly.  As a practical matter for
          now, this means that the cuts we have just defined
          will (eventually) correspond to the positive
          real numbers.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> be cuts.  Then we say
        that <m>\alpha</m> is less than <m>\beta</m>, and write
        <me>
          \alpha\lt \beta
        </me>
        if there is a rational number in <m>\beta</m> which is not in <m>\alpha</m>.

    Note that, in light of what we said prior to <xref
    ref="def_dedekind-cuts-ordering"></xref> (which is
    taken directly from Landau), we notice the following.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_OrderingCuts">

    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove <xref ref="thm_OrderingCuts"></xref> and
        use this to conclude that if <m>\alpha</m> and
        <m>\beta</m> are cuts then exactly one of the following
        is true:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\alpha=\beta</m>.

            <p>
              <m>\alpha\lt \beta</m>.

          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    We will need first to define addition and multiplication for
    our cuts and eventually these will need to be extended to
    <m>\RR</m> (once the non-positive reals have also been
    constructed).  It will be necessary to show that the
    extended definitions satisfy the field axioms.  As you can
    see there is a lot to do.

    As we did with Cauchy sequences and with infinite decimals,
    we will stop well short of the full construction.  If you
    are interested in exploring the details of Dedekind<rsq/>s
    construction, Landau<rsq/>s book<nbsp /><xref
    ref="landau66__found_analy" /> is very thorough and was
    written with the explicit intention that it would be
    accessible to students.  In his <q>Preface for the
    Teacher</q> he says
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        I hope that I have written this book, after a preparation
        stretching over decades, in such a way that a normal
        student can read it in two days.
    </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This may be stretching things.  Give yourself at least a
      week and make sure you have nothing else to do that week.

    <p>
      Addition and multiplication are defined in the obvious way.

    </theorem>

    <proof>
      <p>
        We need to show that the set <m>\alpha+\beta</m> satisfies
        all three of the properties of a cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      <dl width="wide">
    <li> <title>Property I</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>x</m> be any rational number in
      <m>\alpha</m> and let <m>x_1</m> be a rational number
      not in <m>\alpha</m>.  Then by Property II <m>x\lt
      x_1</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>y</m> be any rational number in

      not in <m>\beta</m>.  Then by Property II <m>y\lt
      y_1</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus since <m>x+y</m> represents a generic element of
      <m>\alpha+\beta</m> and <m>x+y\lt x_1+y_1</m>, it
      follows that <m>x_1+y_1\not\in\alpha+\beta</m>.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <title>Property II</title>
    <p>
      We will show that the contrapositive of

      <m>y\in\alpha+\beta</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, let <m>x\in\alpha+\beta</m>.  Then there are
    <m>x_\alpha\in\alpha</m> and <m>x_\beta\in\beta</m>
    such that <m>y\lt x=x_\alpha+x_\beta</m>.  Therefore
    <m>\frac{y}{x_\alpha+x_\beta}\lt 1</m>, so that

      Therefore
    <m>x_\alpha\left(\frac{y}{x_\alpha+x_\beta}\right)\in\alpha</m>
    and
    <m>x_\beta\left(\frac{y}{x_\alpha+x_\beta}\right)\in\beta</m>.
    Therefore

</problem>

<p>
  At this point we have built our cuts and we have defined
  addition and multiplication for cuts.  However, as observed
  earlier the cuts we have will (very soon) correspond only to
  the positive real numbers.  This may appear to be a problem
  but it really isn<rsq/>t because the non-positive real numbers
  can be defined in terms of the positives, that is, in terms
  of our cuts.  We quote from Landau <xref
  ref="landau66__found_analy" />:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    These cuts will henceforth be called the <q>positive
    numbers;</q>  .  .  .
</p>
<p>
  We create a new number <m>0</m> (to be read <q>zero</q>),
  distinct from the positive numbers.
</p>
<p>
  We also create numbers which are distinct from the
  positive numbers as well as distinct from zero, and which
  we will call negative numbers, in such a way that to each
  <m>\xi</m> (I.e. to each positive number) we assign a
  negative number denoted by <m>-\xi</m> (<m>-</m> to be
read <q>minus</q>). In this, <m>-\xi</m> and <m>-\nu</m>
will be considered as the same number (as equal) if and
only if <m>\xi</m> and <m>\nu</m> are the same number.
</p>
<p>
  The totality consisting of all positive numbers, of
  <m>0</m>, and of all negative numbers, will be called the
  real numbers.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Of course it is not nearly enough to simply postulate the
  existence of the non-negative real numbers.
</p>

<p>
  All we have so far is a set of objects we<rsq/>re calling the
  real numbers.  For some of them (the positive reals -- that
  is, the cuts) we have defined addition and multiplication.
  These definitions will eventually turn out to correspond to
  the addition and multiplication we are familiar with.
</p>

<p>
  However we do not have either operation for our entire set
  of proposed real numbers.  Before we do this we need first
  to define the <term>absolute value</term> of a real number.
  This is a concept you are very familiar with and you have
  probably seen the following definition: Let
  <m>\alpha\in\RR</m>.  Then
  <me>
    \abs{\alpha} = \begin{cases}\alpha\amp  \text{ if \(\alpha\ge0,\) } \\ -\alpha\amp  \text{ if \(\alpha\lt 0.\) } \end{cases}
</me>
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately we cannot use this definition because we do
  not yet have a linear ordering on <m>\RR</m> so the
  statement <m>\alpha\ge0</m> is meaningless.  Indeed, it will
  be our definition of absolute value that orders the real
  numbers.  We must be careful.
</p>

<p>
  Notice that by definition a negative real number is denoted
  with the dash (<lsq/><m>-</m><rsq/>) in front.   Thus if <m>A</m>
  is any real number then one of the following is
  true:

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>A=\chi</m> where  <m>\chi</m> is a cut as defined in <xref ref="def_dedekind-cuts" ></xref>  (<m>A</m> is positive)
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <m>A=-\chi</m> where  <m>\chi</m> is a cut as defined in <xref ref="def_dedekind-cuts" ></xref> (<m>A</m> is negative)
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <m>A=0</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  We define absolute value as follows:
</p>

<definition xml:id="def_absolute-value">

  <idx><h>Definition</h><h>absolute value of a Dedekind cut</h></idx>
  <idx><h>absolute value of a Dedekind cut</h></idx>

  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>A\in\RR</m> as above.
      Then
      <me>
        \abs{A}= \begin{cases}\chi \amp  \text{ if \(A=\chi{}\)} \\ 0 \amp  \text{ if \(A=0\) } \\ \chi \amp  \text{ if \(A=-\chi{}.\)} {} \end{cases}
      </me>
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>

<p>
  With this definition in place it is possible to show that
  <m>\RR</m> is linearly ordered.  We will not do this
  explicitly.  Instead we will simply assume that the symbols
  <q><m>\lt</m></q> <q><m>></m>,</q> and <q><m>=</m></q> have
  been defined and have all of the properties we have learned
  to expect from them.
</p>

<p>
  We now extend our definitions of addition and multiplication
  from the positive real numbers (cuts) to all of them.
  Curiously, multiplication is the simpler of the two.

  Notice that the case where <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>
  are both positive was already handled by <xref

  because in that case they are both cuts.

  Next we define addition.

  <p>
    Notice also that the fifth case refers to the addition as
    defined in the second case.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  But wait!  In the second and fourth cases of our definition
  we<rsq/>ve actually defined addition in terms of subtraction. But
  we haven<rsq/>t defined subtraction yet!  Oops!
</p>

<p>
  This is handled with the definition below, but it
  illuminates very clearly the care that must be taken in
  these constructions.  The real numbers are so
  familiar to us that it is extraordinarily easy to make
  unjustified assumptions.
</p>

<p>
  Since the subtractions in the second and fourth cases above
  are done with positive numbers we only need to give meaning
  to the subtraction of cuts.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def_CutSubtraction">
  <idx><h>subtraction of Dedekind cuts</h></idx>
  <idx><h>Definition</h><h>subtraction of Dedekind cuts</h></idx>

  <statement>
    <p>
      If <m>\alpha</m>, <m>\beta</m> and <m>\delta</m> are
      cuts then the expression
      <me>
        \alpha-\beta=\delta
      </me>
      is defined to mean
      <me>
        \alpha=\delta+\beta
        </me>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>

<p>
  Of course, there is the detail of showing that there is such a cut
  <m>\delta</m>.  (We warned you of the tediousness of all this.)
  Landau goes through the details of showing that such a cut exists.
  We will present an alternative by defining the cut
  <m>\alpha-\beta</m> directly (assuming <m>\beta\lt \alpha</m>).  To
  motivate this definition, consider something we are familiar with:
  <m>3-2=1</m>.  In terms of cuts, we want to say that the open
  interval from <m>0</m> to <m>3</m> <q>minus</q> the open interval
  from <m>0</m> to <m>2</m> should give us the open interval from
  <m>0</m> to <m>1</m>.  Taking elements from <m>(0,3)</m> and
  subtracting elements from <m>(0,2)</m> won<rsq/>t do it as we would
  have differences such as <m>2.9-.9=2</m> which is not in the cut
  <m>(0,1)</m>.  A moment<rsq/>s thought tells us that what we need to
  do is take all the elements from <m>(0,3)</m> and subtract all the
  elements from <m>(2,\infty)</m>, restricting ourselves only to those
  which are positive rational numbers.  This prompts the following
  definition.

      Let <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> be cuts with
      <m>\beta\lt \alpha</m>.  Define <m>\alpha-\beta</m> as
      follows:

      It is pretty straightforward to show that

  We will end by saying that no matter how you construct the real
  number system, there is really only one.  More precisely we have
  the following theorem which we state without proof.
</p>
<aside>
  

  <p>
    In fact, not proving this result seems to be standard in real
    analysis references.  Most often it is simply stated as we do
    here.
  </p>
</aside>

<theorem xml:id="thm_R-is-R">

  <idx><h>fields</h><h>any complete, linearly ordered field is isomorphic to <m>\RR</m>.</h></idx>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Any complete, linearly ordered field is isomorphic
      to <m>\RR</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</theorem>
<p>
  Two linearly ordered number fields are said to be
  isomorphic if there is a one-to-one, onto mapping
  between them (such a mapping is called a bijection)
  which preserves addition, multiplication, and order.
  More precisely, if <m>{\cal F}_1</m> and <m>{\cal
  F}_2</m> are both linearly ordered fields, <m>x, y
  \in{\cal F}_1</m> and <m>\phi:{\cal F}_1\rightarrow{\cal
  F}_2</m> is the mapping then

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>\phi(x+y)=\phi(x)+\phi(y)</m>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <m>\phi(x\cdot y) = \phi(x)\cdot\phi(y)</m>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <m>x\lt y \imp \phi(x)\lt \phi(y)</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  Remember that we warned you that these constructions
  were fraught with technical details that are not
  necessarily illuminating.  Nonetheless, at this point,
  you have everything you need to show that the set of all
  real numbers as defined above is linearly ordered and
  satisfies the Least Upper Bound property.
</p>

<p>
  But we will stop here in order, to paraphrase Descartes,
  to leave for you the joy of further discovery.
