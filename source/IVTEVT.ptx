    <title>The Nested Interval Property: Completeness of the Real Number System</title>
    <p>
      In deriving the <xref ref="thm_LagrangeRemainder"
      text="custom">Lagrange</xref> and <xref
      ref="thm_CauchyRemainder" text="custom">Cauchy</xref> forms of
      the remainder for Taylor series, we made use of the <xref
      ref="thm_EVT" text="custom">Extreme Value Theorem</xref>
      (<term>EVT</term>) and <xref ref="IntermediateValueTheorem" text="custom">Intermediate Value Theorem</xref>
      (<term>IVT</term>).  In <xref ref="Continuity"></xref>,
      we produced an analytic definition of continuity that we can use
      to prove these theorems.  Before we can work out the rest of the
      tools needed for those proofs we need to explore the
      make<ndash/>up of the real number system.
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate what we mean, suppose that we have only the
      rational number system available.  We can still use our
      definition of continuity and can still consider continuous
      functions such as <m>f(x)=x^2</m>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that <m>2</m> is a value that lies between <m>f(1)=1</m>
      and <m>f(2)=4</m> so the <xref ref="IntermediateValueTheorem"
      text="custom">IVT</xref> says that somewhere between <m>1</m>
      and <m>2</m>, <m>f</m> must take on the value <m>2</m>.  That
      is, there must exist some number <m>c\in[1,2]</m> such that
      <m>f(c)=2</m>.  You might say, <q>Big deal!  Everyone knows
      <m>c=\sqrt{2}</m> works.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      However, we are only working with rational numbers and
      <m>\sqrt{2}</m> <m></m>is not rational.  As we saw in <xref
      ref="NumbersRealRational"></xref> the rational number
      system has holes in it, whereas the real number system doesn't.
      Again, <q>Big deal!  Let's just say that the real number system
      contains (square) roots.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      This sounds reasonable and it actually works for square roots,
      but consider the function <m>f(x)=x-\cos x</m>.  We know this is
      a continuous function (Why?).  We also know that <m>f(0)=-1</m>
      and <m>f(\frac{\pi}{2})=\frac{\pi}{2}</m>.  Thus according to
      the <xref ref="IntermediateValueTheorem"
      text="custom">IVT</xref>, there should be some number
      <m>c\in[0,\frac{\pi}{2}]</m>, where <m>f(c)=0</m>.  The graph
      of <m>f(x)=x-\cos x</m> is shown below.

    <p>
      The situation is not as transparent as before.  What is this
      mysterious <m>c</m>  where the curve crosses the <m>x</m>
      axis?  Somehow we need to convey the idea that the real number
      system is a continuum, that it is <term>complete</term>.  That is, it has no holes in it.
    </p>

    <p>
      How about this?  Why don<rsq/>t we just assume that it has no
      holes in it?  Sometimes the simplest answer works best! We could
      do that. More complicated statements have been taken as axioms
      in the past. But how are we going to formulate a rigorous proof
      based on the statement, <q>There are no holes in the real
      numbers</q>?
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, going back to the Greeks (and possibly further) the thrust
      of mathematics has always been to keep our axioms as simple and
      self<ndash/>evident as possible and to prove more complicated
      statements from the axioms. If possible. So we<rsq/>d prefer to
      make a simpler assumption (axiom) and use it to show that there
      are no holes in the real numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will see that there are several different, but equivalent
      assumptions we can make that will convey the notion of
      <term>completeness</term>.  We will explore some of them in this
      chapter.  For now we adopt the following as our
      <term>Completeness Axiom</term> for the real number system.

      <idx><h>Completeness Axiom, (the NIP)</h></idx>    

      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose we have two sequences of real numbers
          <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> and <m>\left(y_n\right)</m>
          satisfying the following conditions:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>x_1\leq x_2\leq x_3\leq\ldots</m> (this says that the
                sequence, <m>\left(x_n\right)</m>, is non-decreasing)
              </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>y_1\geq y_2\geq y_3\geq\ldots</m> (this says that the
                sequence, <m>\left(y_n\right)</m>, is non-increasing)
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\forall</m> <m>n</m>, <m>x_n\leq y_n</m>
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(y_n-x_n\right)=0</m>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there exists a unique number <m>c</m> such that
          <m>x_n\leq c\leq y_n</m> for all <m>n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </axiom>
    <p>
      Geometrically, we have the following situation.
    </p>

    </image>

    <p>
      Notice that we have two sequences <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> and
      <m>\left(y_n\right)</m>, one increasing (really non-decreasing)
      and one decreasing (non-increasing).  These sequences do not
      pass each other.  In fact, the following is true:
    </p>

    <problem xml:id="PROBLEMEndpointsNIP">
      
      <idx><h>Nested Interval Property</h><h>endpoints</h></idx>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>(x_n), (y_n)</m> be sequences as in the <xref ref="NIP" text="custom">NIP</xref>. Show
          that for all <m>n, m \in\NN</m>, <m>x_n\le y_m</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      They are also coming together in the sense that
      <m>\limit{n}{\infty}{\left(y_n-x_n\right)}=0</m>.  The <xref ref="NIP" text="custom">NIP</xref> 
      says that in this case there is a unique real number <m>c</m> in
      the middle of all of this: <m>x_n\leq c\leq y_n</m> for all
      <m>n\in\NN</m>.
    </p>

    <image width="75%" source="images/Ch6fig4.png" >
      <shortdescription></shortdescription>
    </image>

    <p>
      If there was no such <m>c</m> then there would be a hole where
      these two sequences come together.  The <xref ref="NIP"
      text="custom">NIP</xref> guarantees that there is no such hole.
      We do not need to prove this since an axiom is, by definition, a
      self evident truth.  We are taking it on faith that the real
      number system has this property.  The next problem shows that
      the completeness property distinguishes the real number system
      from the rational number system.

      You might find the name <term>Nested Interval Property</term> to
      be somewhat curious since it doesn<rsq/>t explicitly identify
      any intervals as such. But in light of <xref
      ref="PROBLEMEndpointsNIP" ></xref> it should be clear that the
      sequences <m>(x_n)</m> and <m>(y_n)</m> are the left and right
      endpoints of a set of nested intervals
      <m>[x_1,y_1]\supseteq[x_2,y_2]\supseteq[x_3,y_3]\supseteq\cdots</m>,
      whose lengths <m>y_n-x_n</m> are shrinking to <m>0</m>.  The
      conclusion says that the intersection of these intervals is
      non<ndash/>empty and in fact, consists of a single point.  That
      is, it says <me>\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty[x_n,y_n]=\{c\}</me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Intuitively, the sequences <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> and
      <m>\left(y_n\right)</m> in the <xref ref="NIP"
      text="custom">NIP</xref> appear to converge to <m>c</m>.  This
      is in fact, true and can be proven rigorously. This will prove
      to be a valuable piece of information for us.

      To illustrate the idea that the <xref ref="NIP" text="custom">NIP</xref>  plugs the holes in
      the real line, we will prove the existence of square roots of
      nonnegative real numbers.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm_SqrtsExist">
      
      <idx><h>square roots exist</h></idx>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>a\in\mathbb{R},\,a\geq 0</m>.  There exists a
          real number <m>c\geq 0</m> such that <m>c^2=a</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      Notice that we can't just say, <q>Let <m>c=\sqrt{a}</m>,</q>
      since the idea is to show that this square root exists.  In
      fact, throughout this proof, we cannot really use a square root
      symbol as we haven't yet proved that square roots exist.  The
      idea behind the proof illustrates how the <xref ref="NIP"
      text="custom">NIP</xref> is used in practice.
    </p>

    <proof>
      <title>Sketch of Proof</title>
      <p>
        Our strategy is to construct two sequences which will narrow
        in on the number <m>c</m> that we seek.  Observe that we need
        to find a number <m>x_1</m> such that <m>x_1^2\leq a</m> and a
        number <m>y_1</m> such that <m>y_1^2\geq a</m>.  (Remember
        that we can't say <m>x_1\lt\sqrt{a}</m> and
        <m>y_1\gt\sqrt{a}</m> since our goal is to show that
        <m>\sqrt{a} </m> exists.)
        There are many possibilities, but how about <m>x_1=0</m> and
        <m>y_1=a+1?</m> You can check that these will satisfy
        <m>x_1^2\leq a\leq</m> <m>y_1^2</m>.  Furthermore <m>x_1\leq
        y_1</m>.  This is the starting point.
      </p>

      <p>
        The technique we will employ is often called a bisection
        technique, and is a useful way to set ourselves up for
        applying the <xref ref="NIP" text="custom">NIP</xref>. Let <m>m_1</m> be the midpoint of the
        interval <m>[\,x_1,y_1]</m>.  Then either we have <m>m_1^2\leq
        a</m> or <m>m_1^2\geq a</m>.  In the case <m>m_1^2\leq a</m>,
        we really want <m>m_1</m> to take the place of <m>x_1</m>
        since it is larger than <m>\,x_1</m>, but still represents an
        underestimate for what would be the square root of <m>a</m>.
        This thinking prompts the following move.  If <m>m_1^2\leq
        a</m>, we will relabel things by letting <m>x_2=m_1</m> and
        <m>y_2=y_1</m>.  The situation looks like this on the number
        line.
      </p>

        <shortdescription></shortdescription>
      </image>

      <p>
        In the other case where <m>a\leq m_1^2</m>, we will relabel
        things by letting <m>x_2=x_1</m> and <m>y_2=m_1</m>.  The
        situation looks like this on the number line.

      <p>
        In either case, we've reduced the length of the interval where
        the square root lies to half the size it was before.  Stated
        in more specific terms, in either case we have the same
        results:

        <md>

          <mrow>
            x_1\leq x_2\leq y_2\leq y_1,
            \amp{}            \amp{}
            x_1^2\leq a\leq y_1^2,
            \amp{}\amp{}
            x_2^2\leq a\leq y_2^2,
          </mrow>

            and

            </md>
          </p>

      <p>
        Now we play the same game, but instead we start with the
        interval <m>[x_2,y_2]</m>.  Let <m>m_2</m> be the midpoint of
        <m>[x_2,y_2]</m>.  Then we have <m>m_2^2\leq a</m> or
        <m>m_2^2\geq a</m>.  If <m>m_2^2\leq a</m>, we relabel
        <m>x_3=m_2</m> and <m>y_3=y_2</m>.  If <m>a\leq m_2^2</m>, we
        relabel <m>x_3=x_2</m> and <m>y_3=m_2</m>.  In either case, we
        end up with

        <me>
          x_1\leq x_2\leq x_3\leq y_3\leq y_2\leq y_1,

            <intertext>
              and

            <mrow>
              y_3-x_3=\frac{1}{2}\left(y_2-x_2\right)=\frac{1}{2^2}\left(y_1-x_1\right).

      <p>
        Continuing in this manner, will produce two sequences,
        <m>\left(x_n\right)</m>and <m>\left(y_n\right)</m> satisfying
        the following conditions:

        <dl>
          <li>
            <title>Condition 1:</title>
            <p>
              <m>x_1\leq x_2\leq x_3\leq\ldots</m>

          <li>
            <title>Condition 2:</title>
            <p>
              <m>y_1\geq y_2\geq y_3\geq\ldots</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>Condition 3:</title>
            <p>


              <m>\forall</m> <m>n</m>, <m>x_n\leq y_n</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>Condition 4:</title>
            <p>
              <m>\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(y_n-x_n\right)=\,\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\left(y_1-x_1\right)=0</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>Condition 5:</title>
            <p>
              These sequences also satisfy the following property:
              <me>
                \forall n,\,x_n^2\leq a\leq y_n^2
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>
        </dl>
      </p>

      <p>
        Conditions 1 through 4 tell us that <m>\left(x_n\right)</m>and
        <m>\left(y_n\right)</m> satisfy all of the conditions of the
        <xref ref="NIP" text="custom">NIP</xref>, so we can conclude that there must exist a real number

    <p>
      The bisection method we employed to prove <xref
      ref="thm_SqrtsExist"></xref> is also pretty typical of how we
      will use the <xref ref="NIP" text="custom">NIP</xref>, as it
      ensures that we will create a sequence of nested intervals with
      meet all of the conditions specified in the <xref ref="NIP"
      text="custom">NIP</xref>. We will employ this strategy in the
      proofs of the <xref ref="IntermediateValueTheorem"
      text="custom">IVT</xref> and <xref ref="thm_EVT"
      text="custom">EVT</xref>. Deciding how to relabel the endpoints
      of our intervals will be determined by what we want to do with
      these two sequences of real numbers.  This will typically lead
      to a fifth property, which will be crucial in proving that the
      <m>c</m> guaranteed by the <xref ref="NIP"
      text="custom">NIP</xref> does what we want it to do.
      Specifically, in the above example, we always wanted our
      candidate for <m>\sqrt{a}</m> to be in the interval
      <m>[\,x_n,y_n]</m>.  This judicious choice led to the extra
      Condition 5: <m>\forall</m> <m>n,\,x_n^2\leq a\leq y_n^2</m>.
      In applying the <xref ref="NIP" text="custom">NIP</xref> to
      prove the <xref ref="IntermediateValueTheorem"
      text="custom">IVT</xref> and <xref ref="thm_EVT"
      text="custom">EVT</xref>, Condition 5 is what will change based
      on the property we want <m>c</m> to have.

      Before we tackle the <xref ref="IntermediateValueTheorem"
      text="custom">IVT</xref> and <xref ref="thm_EVT"
      text="custom">EVT</xref>, let<rsq/>s use the <xref ref="NIP"
      text="custom">NIP</xref> to address an interesting question
      about the Harmonic Series.   Recall that the
      Harmonic Series,
      <m>1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}+\cdots</m>, grows
      without bound. That is,
      <m>\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n}=\infty</m>.  The question is how
      slowly does this series grow?  For example, how many terms would
      it take before the series surpasses 100? Or 1000?  Or 10000?
    </p>
    <p>
      <idx><h>Euler, Leonhard</h></idx>

      Leonhard Euler decided to tackle this problem in the following
      way.  He decided to consider the
      <men xml:id="EQUATIONEulerGamma">
        \limit{n}{\infty}{\left[\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+
        \frac{1}{n}\right)-\ln(n+1)\right]} </men>.  This limit is
        called Euler's constant and is traditionally denoted by
        <m>\gamma</m>.  <xref ref="EQUATIONEulerGamma"
        >Equation</xref> says that for very large values of <m>n</m>,
        we have
        <me>
          1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}\approx
          \ln\left(n+1\right)+\gamma
          </me>.

          If we could approximate <m>\gamma</m>, then we could replace
        the inequality
        <m>1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}\geq 100</m>
        with the more tractable inequality
        ln<m>\left(n+1\right)+\gamma</m> <m>\geq 0</m> and solve for
        <m>n</m> in this.  This should tell us roughly how many terms
        would need to be added in the Harmonic Series to surpass 100.
        Approximating <m>\gamma</m> with a computer is not too bad.
        We could make <m>n</m> as large as we wish in
        <m>\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}\right)-</m>ln<m>\left(1+n\right)</m>
        to make closer approximations for <m>\gamma</m>.  The real
        issue is, how do we know that

        <me>
          \limit{n}{\infty}{\left[\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+
          \frac{1}{n}\right)-\ln(n+1)\right]}
          </me>

          actually exists?  As of the time we are writing this book it
          is not even known if <m>\gamma</m> is rational or
          irrational.  So in our opinion, the existence of this limit
          is not obvious.  And even if it were, a formal proof would
          be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will use the <xref ref="NIP" text="custom">NIP</xref> to show that this limit does in
      fact exist.  The details are in the following problem.

      We now have all of the tools we need to prove the <xref
      ref="IntermediateValueTheorem" text="custom">Intermediate Value
      Theorem</xref> (<term>IVT</term>).
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="IntermediateValueTheorem">
      <title>Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)</title>

      <idx><h>Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)</h></idx> 

      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>f(x)</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and
          <m>v</m> is any real number between <m>f(a)</m> and
          <m>f(b)</m>.  Then there exists a real number
          <m>c\in[\,a,b]</m> such that <m>f(c)=v</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <proof>
      <title>Sketch of Proof</title>
      <p>
        We have two cases to consider: <m>f(a)\leq v\leq f(b)</m> and
        <m>f(a)\geq v\geq f(b)</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will look at the case <m>f(a)\leq v\leq f(b)</m>.  Let
        <m>x_1=a</m> and <m>y_1=b</m>. So we have 

        <me>
          x_1\leq y_1\text{ and } f(x_1)\leq v\leq f(y_1)
          </me>.  
          Let <m>\,m_1</m> be the
        midpoint of <m>[\,x_1,y_1]</m> and notice that we have either
       
        <me>
f(m_1)\leq v\text{ or }f(m_1)\geq v
</me>.  
        If <m>f(m_1)\leq
        v</m> , then we relabel <m>x_2=m_1</m> and <m>y_2=y_1</m>.  If
        <m>f(m_1)\geq v</m> , then we relabel <m>x_2=x_1</m> and
        <m>y_2=m_1</m>.  In either case, we end up with 
        <me>
x_1\leq
        x_2\leq y_2\leq y_1
</me>,
        <me>
y_2-x_2=\frac{1}{2}\left(y_1-x_1\right)
</me>, 
<me>f(x_1)\leq
v\leq f(y_1)
</me>, and 
<me>f(x_2)\leq v\leq f(y_2)</me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now play the same game with the interval <m>[\,x_2,y_2]</m>.
        If we keep playing this game, we will generate two sequences
        <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> and <m>\left(y_n\right)</m>,
        satisfying all of the conditions of the nested interval
        property.  These sequences will also satisfy the following
        extra property: <m>\forall</m> <m>n,\,f(x_n)\leq v\leq
        f(y_n)</m>.  By the <xref ref="NIP" text="custom">NIP</xref>, there exists a <m>c</m> such that
        <m>\,x_n\leq c\leq y_n</m>, <m>\forall</m> <m>n</m>.  This
        should be the <m>c</m> that we seek though this is not
        obvious.  Specifically, we need to show that <m>f(c)=v</m>.
        This should be where the continuity of <m>f</m> at <m>c</m>
        and the extra property on <m>\left(x_n\right)</m>and
        <m>\left(y_n\right)</m> come into play.

    <title>The Bolzano<ndash/>Weierstrass Theorem</title>
    <p>
      The <xref ref="IntermediateValueTheorem"
      text="custom">Intermediate Value Theorem</xref> followed pretty
      readily once we introduced the <xref ref="NIP"
      text="custom">Nested Interval Property</xref>.  The proof of
      <xref ref="thm_EVT" text="custom">Extreme Value Theorem</xref>
      takes a bit more work.  First we need the result of <xref
      ref="thm_CompactBounded" ></xref> below.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm_CompactBounded">
    
      <idx><h>continuous functions</h><h>continuous function on a closed, bounded interval is bounded</h></idx> 

      <statement>
        <p>
          A continuous function defined on a closed, bounded interval
          must be bounded.  That is, let <m>f</m> be a continuous
          function defined on <m>[\,a,b]</m>.  Then there exists a
          positive real number <m>B</m> such that <m>|f(x)|\leq B</m>
          for all <m>x\in[\,a,b]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      <alert>Sketch of Alleged Proof:</alert> Let's assume,
      for contradiction, that there is no such bound <m>B</m>.
      This says that for any positive integer <m>n</m>,
      there must exist <m>x_n\in[a,b]</m> such that <m>\abs{f(x_n)}>n</m>.
      (Otherwise <m>n</m> would be a bound for <m>f</m>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <alert>IF</alert> the sequence <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> converges
      to, say <m>c\in[a,b]</m>, then we would have our contradiction.
      Indeed, we would have <m>\limit{n}{\infty}{x_n}=c</m>, and by
      the continuity of <m>f</m> at <m>c</m> and <xref
      ref="thm_LimDefOfContinuity"></xref> we would have
      <m>\limit{n}{\infty}{f(x_n)}=f(c)</m> which implies that the
      sequence <m>\left(f(x_n)\right)</m> converges. So by <xref
      ref="lemma_BoundedConvergent"></xref> the sequence
      <m>\left(f(x_n)\right)</m> must be bounded.  This would provide
      our contradiction since, by construction
      <m>\abs{f(x_n)}\gt{}n</m>, for all positive integers
      <m>n</m>. <alert>QED?</alert>
    </p>

    <p>
      This would work well except for one little problem.
      The way it was constructed,
      there is no reason to expect the sequence
      <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> to converge to anything
      That is why we emphasized the <alert>IF</alert> above.
      Fortunately, this idea can be salvaged.
      While it is true that the sequence
      <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> may not converge, part of it will.
      We will need the following definition.

          that is, <m>n_1\lt n_2\lt n_3\lt \cdots</m> . If <m>\left(x_n\right)_{n=1}^\infty</m> is a sequence,
          then <m>\left(x_{n_k}\right)_{k=1}^\infty=\left(x_{n_1},x_{n_2},x_{n_3},\ldots \right)</m> is called a subsequence of <m>\left(x_n\right)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      The idea is that a subsequence of a sequence is a part of the sequence,
      <m>(x_n)</m>, which is itself a sequence.
      However, it is a little more restrictive.
      We can choose any term in our sequence to be part of the subsequence,
      but once we choose that term, we can't go backwards.
      This is where the condition <m>n_1\lt n_2\lt n_3\lt \cdots</m> comes in.
      For example,
      suppose we started our subsequence with the term <m>x_{100}</m>.
      We could not choose our next term to be <m>x_{99}</m>.
      The subscript of the next term would have to be greater than 100.
      In fact, the thing about a subsequence is that it is all in the subscripts;
      we are really choosing a subsequence
      <m>\left(n_k\right)</m> of the sequence of subscripts
      <m>\left(n\right)</m> in <m>\left(x_n\right)</m>.

      A very important theorem about subsequences was introduced by Bernhard Bolzano and was later proven independently 
      by Karl Weierstrass.
      Basically, this theorem says that any bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="BolzanoWeierstrass">
      <title>The Bolzano<ndash/>Weierstrass Theorem</title>

      <idx><h>Bolzano<ndash/>Weierstrass Theorem</h></idx>  
      <idx><h>BWT</h><see>Bolzano<ndash/>Weierstrass Theorem</see></idx>  

      <statement>

        <p>
          Let <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> be a sequence of real numbers such
          that <m>x_n\in[\,a,b]</m>, <m>\forall</m> <m>n</m>.  Then
          there exists <m>c\in[\,a,b]</m> and a subsequence
          <m>\left(x_{n_k}\right)</m>, such that
          <m>\limit{k}{\infty}{x_{n_k}}=c</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      As an example of this theorem, consider the sequence
      <me>
        \left((-1)^n\right)=\left(-1,1,-1,1,\ldots\right) 
        </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This sequence does not converge, but the subsequence
      <me>
        \left((-1)^{2k}\right)=\left(1,1,1,\ldots\right)
      </me>
      converges to <m>1</m>.  This is not the only convergent
      subsequence. For example, the subsequence
      <me>
        \left((-1)^{2k+1}\right)=(-1,-1,-1,\,\ldots)
      </me>
      also converges to <m>-1</m>.  Notice that if the sequence is
      unbounded, then all bets are off. The sequence may have a
      convergent subsequence or it may not.  The sequences

      <md>
        <mrow>
          \left(\left((-1)^n+1\right)n\right) \amp{}\amp{}\text{ and }
          \amp{}\amp{}\left(n\right)
        </mrow>
</md>

represent these possibilities as the first
contains for example, the convergent subsequence
<m>\left(\left((-1)^{2k+1}+1\right)(2k+1)\right)=(0,0,0,\ldots)</m>
and all subsequences of the the second diverge to infinity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Bolzano<ndash/>Weierstrass Theorem says that no matter how 
      the sequence <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> is produced,
      as long as it is bounded then it contains a  convergent subsequence.
      This can be very useful. In particular the sequence <m>(x_n)</m> that appears in our Alleged Proof
      is bounded since <m>x_n\in [a,b]\  \forall \ n\in\NN</m>. So it contains a convegent subsequence.
    </p>

    <proof>
      <title>Sketch of a Proof of the Bolzano<ndash/>Weierstrass Theorem</title>
      <p>
        Suppose we have our sequence <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> such that
        <m>x_n\in[a,b]</m>, <m>\forall</m> <m>n</m>, as in the Alleged
        Proof above.  To find our <m>c</m> for the subsequence to
        converge to we will use the <xref ref="NIP"
        text="custom">NIP</xref>. Since we are already using
        <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> as our original sequence, we will need
        to use different letters in setting ourselves up for the <xref
        ref="NIP" text="custom">NIP</xref>. With this in mind, let
        <m>a_1=a</m> and <m>b_1=b</m>, and notice that
        <m>x_n\in[a_1,b_1]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>.  (This
        is, in fact true for all <m>n</m>, but you'll see why we said
        it the way we did.)  Let <m>m_1</m> be the midpoint of
        <m>[a_1,b_1]</m> and notice that either <m>x_n\in[a_1,m_1]</m>
        for infinitely many <m>n</m> or <m>x_n\in[m_1,b_1]</m> for
        infinitely many <m>n</m>.  If <m>x_n\in[a_1,m_1]</m> for
        infinitely many <m>n</m>, then we relabel <m>a_2=a_1</m> and
        <m>b_2=m_1</m>.  If <m>x_n\in[m_1,b_1]</m> for infinitely many
        <m>n</m>, then relabel <m>a_2=m_1</m> and <m>b_2=b_1</m>.  In
        either case, we get <m>a_1\leq a_2\leq b_2\leq b_1</m>,
        <m>b_2-a_2=\frac{1}{2}\left(b_1-a_1\right)</m>, and
        <m>x_n\in[a_2,b_2]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now we consider the interval
        <m>[a_2,b_2]</m> and let <m>m_2</m> be the midpoint of <m>[a_2,b_2]</m>.
        Since <m>x_n\in[a_2,b_2]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>,
        then either <m>x_n\in[a_2,m_2]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m> or
        <m>x_n\in[m_2,b_2]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>.
        If <m>x_n\in[a_2,m_2]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>,
        then we relabel <m>a_3=a_2</m> and <m>b_3=m_2</m>.
        If <m>x_n\in[m_2,b_2]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>,
        then we relabel <m>a_3=m_2</m> and <m>b_3=b_2</m>.
        In either case,
        we get <m>a_1\leq a_2\leq a_3\leq b_3\leq b_2\leq b_1</m>,
        <m>b_3-a_3=\frac{1}{2}\left(b_2-a_2\right)=\frac{1}{2^2}\left(b_1-a_1\right)</m>,
        and <m>x_n\in[a_3,b_3]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we continue in this manner,
        we will produce two sequences <m>\left(a_k\right)</m>and
        <m>\left(b_k\right)</m> with the following properties:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>a_1\leq a_2\leq a_3\leq\cdots</m>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>b_1\geq b_2\geq b_3\geq\cdots</m>

            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              For each <m>k</m>,
              <m>x_n\in[\,a_k,b_k]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        By properties 1-4 and the <xref ref="NIP" text="custom">NIP</xref>, there exists a unique <m>c</m> such that <m>c\in[a_k,b_k]</m>,
        for all <m>k</m>.
        In particular, <m>c\in[a_1,b_1]=[a,b]</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have our <m>c</m>.
        Now we need to construct a subsequence converging to it.
        Since <m>x_n\in[a_1,b_1]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>,
        choose an integer <m>n_1</m> such that <m>x_{n_1}\in[a_1,b_1]</m>.
        Since <m>x_n\in[a_2,b_2]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>,
        choose an integer <m>n_2>n_1</m> such that <m>x_{n_2}\in[a_2,b_2]</m>.
        (Notice that to make a subsequence it is crucial that <m>n_2>n_1</m>,
        and this is why we needed to insist that
        <m>x_n\in[a_2,b_2]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>.)
        Continuing in this manner,
        we should be able to build a subsequence
        <m>\left(x_{n_k}\right)</m> that will converge to <m>c</m>.
        You can supply the details in the following problem.

    <title>The Supremum and the Extreme Value Theorem</title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="thm_CompactBounded"></xref>
      says that a continuous function on a closed,
      bounded interval must be bounded.
      Boundedness, in and of itself,
      does not ensure the existence of a maximum or minimum.
      We must also have a closed, bounded interval.
      To illustrate this,
      consider the continuous function <m>f(x)=</m>tan<m>^{-1}x</m> defined on the (unbounded) interval <m>\left(-\infty,\infty\right)</m>.
    </p>

    <image width="75%" source="images/Ch6fig8-1.png" >
      <shortdescription></shortdescription>
    </image>

    <p>
      This function is bounded between
      <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}</m>and <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>,
      but it does not attain a maximum or minimum as the lines
      <m>y=\pm\frac{\pi}{2}</m> are horizontal asymptotes.
      Notice that if we restricted the domain to a closed,
      bounded interval then it would attain its extreme values on that interval
      (as guaranteed by the <xref ref="thm_EVT" text="custom"><term>EVT</term></xref>).
    </p>

    <p>
      To find a maximum we need to find the smallest possible upper bound for the range of the function.
      This prompts the following definitions.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def_UpperBound">
      
      <idx><h>Upper Bound</h></idx>
      <idx><h>Definition</h><h>Upper Bound</h></idx>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>S\subseteq\mathbb{R}</m> and let <m>b</m> be a real number.
          We say that <m>b</m> is an upper bound of
          <m>S</m> provided <m>b\geq x</m> for all <m>x\in S</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      For example, if <m>S=(0,1)</m>,
      then any <m>b</m> with <m>b\geq 1</m> would be an upper bound of <m>S</m>.
      Furthermore,
      the fact that <m>b</m> is not an element of the set <m>S</m> is immaterial.
      Indeed, if <m>T=[\,0,1]</m>,
      then any <m>b</m> with <m>b\geq 1</m> would still be an upper bound of <m>T</m>.
      Notice that, in general, if a set has an upper bound,
      then it has infinitely many since any number larger than that upper bound would also be an upper bound.
      However, there is something special about the smallest upper bound.

        <p>
          Let <m>S\subseteq\mathbb{R}</m> and let <m>b</m> be a real
          number.  We say that <m>b</m> is the <em>least upper
          bound</em> of <m>S</m> provided

        <p>
          <ol marker="(a)">

              <p>
                If <m>c\geq x</m> for all <m>x\in S</m>, then <m>c\geq b</m>.
                (Any upper bound of <m>S</m> is at least as big as <m>b</m>.)
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, we also say that
          <m>b</m> <em>is the supremum</em> of <m>S</m> and we write
          <me>
            b=\sup S
            </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Notice that the definition really says that <m>b</m> is the smallest upper bound of <m>S</m>.
      Also notice that the second condition can be replaced by its contrapositive so we can say that <m>b=\sup S</m> if and only if

      <ol marker="(a)">
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>b\,\geq\,x\text{ for all } x\,\in S</m>

        <li>
          <!-- <title>(ii)</title> -->
          <p>
            If <m>c\,\lt \,b</m> then there exists
            <m>x\,\in S</m> such that <m>c\,\lt \,x</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      The second condition says that if a number <m>c</m> is less than <m>b</m>,
      then it can't be an upper bound,
      so that <m>b</m> really is the smallest upper bound.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also notice that the supremum of the set may or may not be in the set itself.
      This is illustrated by the examples above as in both cases,
      <m>1=\sup(0,1)</m> and <m>1=\sup [0,1]</m>.
      Obviously, a set which is not bounded above such as
      <m>\mathbb{N}=\{1,\,2,\,3,\,\ldots\}</m> cannot have a supremum.
      However, for non-empty sets which are bounded above, we have the following.

      <title>The Least Upper Bound Property (<term>LUBP</term>)</title>
    
      <idx><h>Least Upper Bound Property</h></idx> 

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>S</m> be a non<ndash/>empty subset of
        <m>\mathbb{R}</m> which is bounded above.
        Then <m>S</m> has a supremum.
      </p>
    </statement>
    </theorem>

    <proof>
      <title>Sketch of Proof</title>
      <p>
        Since <m>S\neq\emptyset</m>, then there exists <m>s\in S</m>.
        Since <m>S</m> is bounded above then it has an upper bound,
        say <m>b</m>.
        We will set ourselves up to use the Nested Interval Property.
        With this in mind,
        let <m>x_1=s</m> and <m>y_1=b</m> and notice that <m>\exists</m> <m>x\in S</m> such that <m>x\geq x_1</m> (namely,
        <m>x_1</m> itself) and <m>\forall\,x\in S</m>, <m>y_1\geq x</m>.
        You probably guessed what's coming next:
        let <m>m_1</m> be the midpoint of <m>[\,x_1,y_1]</m>.
        Notice that either <m>m_1\geq x,\,\forall\,x\in S</m> or <m>\exists</m> <m>x\in S</m> such that <m>x\geq m_1</m>.
        In the former case, we relabel,
        letting <m>x_2=x_1</m> and <m>y_2=m_1</m>.
        In the latter case, we let <m>x_2=m_1</m> and <m>y_2=y_1</m>.
        In either case, we end up with <m>x_1\leq x_2\leq y_2\leq y_1</m>,
        <m>y_2-x_2=\frac{1}{2}\left(y_1-x_1\right)</m>,
        and <m>\exists</m> <m>x\in S</m> such that
        <m>x\geq x_2</m> and <m>\forall\,x\in S</m>, <m>y_2\geq x</m>.
        If we continue this process, we end up with two sequences,
        <m>\left(x_n\right)</m>and <m>\left(y_n\right)</m>,
        satisfying the following conditions:

      Notice that we really used the fact that <m>S</m> was non-empty and bounded above in the proof of <xref ref="thm_LUB"></xref>.
      This makes sense,
      since a set which is not bounded above cannot possibly have a least upper bound.
      In fact, any real number is an upper bound of the empty set so that the empty set would not have a least upper bound.

          <p>
            Suppose <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m>.
            Then there exists <m>c,d\in[a,b]</m> such that <m>f(d)\leq f(x)\leq f(c)</m>,
            for all <m>x\in[a,b]</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>

      <proof>
        <title>Sketch of Proof</title>
        <p>
          We will first show that <m>f</m> attains its maximum.
          To this end,
          recall that <xref ref="thm_CompactBounded"></xref>
          tells us that <m>f[\,a,b]=\{f(x)|\,x\in[\,a,b]\}</m> is a bounded set.
          By the <xref ref="thm_LUB" text="custom">LUBP</xref>, <m>f[a,b]</m> must have a least upper bound which we will label <m>s</m>,
          so that <m>s=\sup f[a,b]</m>.
          This says that <m>s\geq f(x)</m>,for all <m>x\in[a,b]</m>.
          All we need to do now is find a <m>c\in[\,a,b]</m> with <m>f(c)=s</m>.
          With this in mind, notice that since <m>s=\sup f[\,a,b]</m>,
          then for any positive integer <m>n</m>,
          <m>s-\frac{1}{n}</m> is not an upper bound of <m>f[\,a,b]</m>.
          Thus there exists <m>x_n\in[\,a,b]</m> with<m>\,s-\frac{1}{n}\lt f(x_n)\leq s</m>.
          Now, by the <xref ref="BolzanoWeierstrass" text="custom">Bolzano<ndash/>Weierstrass Theorem</xref>,
          <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> has a convergent subsequence<m>\,\left(x_{n_k}\right)</m> converging to some <m>c\in[\,a,b]</m>.
          Using the continuity of <m>f</m> at <m>c</m>,
          you should be able to show that <m>f(c)=s</m>.
          To find the minimum of <m>f</m>,
          find the maximum of <m>-f</m>.

        Notice that we used the <xref ref="NIP" text="custom">NIP</xref>

        ref="thm_LUB" text="custom">LUBP</xref>. This is really
        unavoidable, as it turns out that all of those statements are
        equivalent in the sense that any one of them can be taken as the
        completeness axiom for the real number system and the others
        proved as theorems.  This is not uncommon in mathematics, as
        people tend to gravitate toward ideas that suit the particular
        problem they are working on.  In this case, people realized at
        some point that they needed some sort of completeness property
        for the real number system to prove various theorems.  Each
        individual's formulation of completeness fit in with his
        understanding of the problem at hand.  Only in hindsight do we
        see that they were really talking about the same concept: the
        completeness of the real number system.  In point of fact, most
        modern textbooks use the <xref
        ref="thm_LUB" text="custom">LUBP</xref> as the axiom of completeness and
        prove all other formulations as theorems.  We will finish this
        section by showing that either the <xref
        ref="BolzanoWeierstrass"
        text="custom">Bolzano<ndash/>Weierstrass Theorem</xref> or the
        <xref ref="thm_LUB" text="custom">LUBP</xref> can be used to
        prove the <xref ref="NIP" text="custom">NIP</xref>. This says
        that they are all equivalent and that any one of them could be
        taken as the completeness axiom.

            That is, assume that every non-empty subset of the real numbers which is bounded above has a least upper bound;
            and suppose that we have two sequences of real numbers

            Prove that there is a unique real number <m>c</m> such that <m>x_n\le c\le y_n</m>,

        <statement>
          <p>
            Since the <xref ref="thm_LUB" text="custom">LUBP</xref> is
            equivalent to the <xref ref="NIP" text="custom">NIP</xref>
            it does not hold for the rational number system.
            Demonstrate this by finding a non<ndash/>empty set of
            rational numbers which is bounded above, but whose
            supremum is an irrational number.

        We now have the machinery in place to prove the <xref

        Property</xref> of the real number system as we promised
        we<rsq/>d to back in <xref ref="NumbersRealRational"></xref>.
        We mentioned in <xref ref="NumbersRealRational"></xref>, that
        until the invention of Calculus this was taken to be intuitively
        obvious but we can now prove it as a formal theorem. The proof
        depends on the completeness of the real number system.

        You might reasonably ask if the <xref
        ref="thm_ArchmedeanProperty" text="custom">Archimedean
        Property</xref> is equivalent to the <xref ref="thm_LUB"
        text="custom">Least Upper Bound Property</xref> (and thus could
        be taken as an axiom).  The answer lies in the following
        problem.
