    <title>Taylor<rsq/>s Formula</title>
    <p>
      As we saw in <xref ref="SECTIONPowSerWOTaylor"></xref>,
      representing functions as power series was a fruitful strategy for
      mathematicans in the eighteenth century (as it still is).
      Differentiating and integrating power series term by term was
      relatively easy, <em>seemed</em> to work, and led to many
      applications.  Furthermore, power series representations for all
      of the elementary functions could be obtained if one was clever
      enough. However, cleverness is an unreliable tool.  It would be
      better to have some systematic way to find a power series for a
      given function that doesn<rsq/>t rely on being sufficiently cleve.
    </p>

    <p>
      To be sure, there were nagging questions. For example. even if we
      can find a power series representation of some function, how do we
      know that the series we<rsq/>ve created represents the function we
      started with?  Even worse, is it possible for a function to have
      more than one power series representation centered at a given
      value <m>a?</m> This uniqueness issue is addressed by the
      following theorem.
    </p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(x-a)^n</m>,
          then <m>a_n=\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}</m>,
          where <m>f^{(n)}(a)</m> represents the <m>n</m>th derivative of <m>f</m> evaluated at <m>a</m>.

      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      A few comments about <xref ref="THEOREMTaylorPoly"></xref> are in order.  Notice
      that we did <em>not</em> start with a function and derive its
      series representation.  Instead we <em>defined</em> <m>f(x)</m> to
      be the series we wrote down.  This assumes that the expression
      <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(x-a)^n</m> actually has meaning (that it
      converges).  At this point we have every reason to expect that it
      does, however expectation is not proof so we note that this is an
      assumption, not an established truth.  We<rsq/>ve also assumed
      that we can differentiate an infinite polynomial term-by-term as
      we would a finite polynomial.  As before, we follow in the
      footsteps of our 18th century forebears in making these
      assumptions.  For now.

      Taylor</url> (1685<ndash/>1731) was the first to publish this

      (1698<ndash/>1746) in his <em>Treatise of Fluxions</em> (1742).
      Thus when <m>a=0</m>, the series
      <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n</m> is often called
      the <term>Maclaurin Series</term> for <m>f</m>.

    <p>
      The <term>prime notation</term> for the derivative was not used by
      Taylor, Maclaurin or their contemporaries.  It was introduced by
      Joseph Louis Lagrange in his 1779 work <foreign>Thèorie des
      Fonctions Analytiques</foreign>. In that work, Lagrange sought to
      get rid of Leibniz<rsq/> infinitesimals and base Calculus on the
      power series idea.  His idea was that by representing every
      function as a power series, Calculus could be done
      algebraically by manipulating power series and examining
      various aspects of the series representation instead of appealing
      to the controversial notion of infinitesimals.  He
      implicitly assumed that every continuous function could be
      replaced with its power series representation.

    <p>
      That is, he wanted to think of the Taylor series as a
      <q>great big polynomial,</q>
      because polynomials are easy to work with.
      It was a very simple, yet exceedingly clever and far-reaching idea.
      Since <m>e^x = 1 +x +x^2/2 +\ldots</m>, for example,
      why not just define the exponential to be the series and work with the series.
      After all, the series is just a very long polynomial.
    </p>

    <p>
      This idea did not come out of nowhere. Particular infinite series,
      such as the <xref ref="EQUATIONGeometricSeries"
      text="custom">Geometric Series</xref> had been known and studied
      for many years.  Later, in the 18th century Leonhard Euler used
      infinite series to solve many problems, and some of his solutions
      are still quite breath<ndash/>taking when you first see them<nbsp
      /><xref ref="sandifer07__early_mathem_leonar_euler" />.
    </p>




    <p>
      Taking his cue from the Taylor series
      <men xml:id="EQUATIONTaylorSeriesGeneric">
        f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n
      </men>
      Lagrange observed that the coefficient of <m>(x-a)^n</m> provides
      the <m>n</m>th derivative of <m>f</m> at <m>a</m> (divided by <m>n!</m>).
      Modifying <xref ref="EQUATIONTaylorSeriesGeneric" >formula</xref>
      to suit his purpose, Lagrange supposed that every differentiable
      function could be represented as
      <me>
        f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty g_n(a)(x-a)^n
        </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In that case <m>g_1(a)</m> is the derivative of <m>f</m> at
      <m>a</m>, <m>f^{\prime\prime}(a)=2g_2(a)</m> and generally
      <me>
        f^{(n)}(a)=n! g_n(a)
        </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lagrange dubbed his function <m>g_1</m> the
      <foreign><q>fonction dérivée</q></foreign>
      from which we get the modern name <term>derivative</term>.

    <p>

      As we observed in <xref
      ref="CalcIn17th18thCentury-NewtLeibStart" ></xref> Leibniz and
      his peers would have regarded the expression <m>\dfdx{z}{x}
      </m> as a fraction (of differentials) so they would have derived the formula
      
      <men xml:id="EQUATIONChainRuleLeibniz">
        \dfdx{z}{y}\dfdx{y}{x}=\dfdx{z}{x}
      </men> 

      by simply canceling the <m>\dx{y}</m> that appears in the
      numerator and denominator, just as we did in <xref
      ref="CalcIn17th18thCentury-NewtLeibStart" ></xref> (or sometimes
      by <q>uncancelling</q> them to get the left side of <xref
      ref="EQUATIONChainRuleLeibniz" >equation</xref> from the right
      side).  Mathematicians of that era would have regarded this
      operation as basic algebra.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eighteenth and nineteenth century arithmetic primers used the
      phrase <q>chain rule</q> to describe the daisy<ndash/>chain of
      symbolic cancellations that occurs when we convert
      units. For example, to convert yards to inches we compute
      <me>
        \left(2\cancel{\text{ yards}}\right)\left(3\frac{\cancel{\text{feet}}}{\cancel{\text{yard}}}\right)\left(12\frac{\text{inches}}{\cancel{\text{foot}}}\right)=72\text{ inches}
        </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the cancellations in <xref ref="EQUATIONChainRuleLeibniz"
      >equation</xref> appeared to be just another example of the
      older <q>chain rule</q> the name was adopted by 20th century
      Calculus textbooks even though in modern times it is better
      understood as a mnemonic for the deeper and more abstract
      operation of computing the derivative of composed functions like
      <m>f(g(x))</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Letting <m>z=f(y)</m> and <m>y=g(x)</m> and using
      Lagrange<rsq/>s prime notation we see that in modern form the
      chain rule for Calculus is:

      <me> 
        \dfdx{z}{x}=\left(f\circ
        g\right)^\prime\left(x\right)=\underbrace{f^\prime\left(g\left(x\right)\right)}_{\dfdx{z}{y}}\underbrace{g^\prime(x)}_{\dfdx{y}{x}{}}
        </me>.

Which obviously looks nothing like the older chain rule seen as
      in <xref ref="EQUATIONChainRuleLeibniz" >equation</xref>
    </p>
    <p>


      In his <foreign>Théorie des  fonctions analytiques</foreign> (1797)
      Lagrange  provided a derivation of the Chain Rule in these more 
      modern terms.   The following problem captures his idea.

    <p>
      All in all, Lagrange<rsq/>s idea was very clever and
      insightful. It<rsq/>s only real flaw is that the fundamental,
      underlying assumption is not true.  It turns out that not every
      differentiable function can be represented as a Taylor series.
      This was demonstrated very dramatically by Augustin
      Cauchy<rsq/>s famous counter-example
      <men xml:id="eq_CauchyCounterEx">
        f(x) = \begin{cases} e^{-\frac{1}{x^2}}\amp  x\ne0\\ 0 \amp x=0 \end{cases}
        </men>.
    </p>

    <p> 
      This function is actually infinitely differentiable everywhere
      but its Maclaurin series (that is, its Taylor series with
      <m>a=0</m>) does not converge to <m>f</m> (except, trivially, at
      the origin) because all of its derivatives at the origin are
      equal to zero. That is <m>f^{(n)}(0) = 0, \forall\, n \in
      \NN</m>.
    </p>


    <p>
      To begin with, let<rsq/>s compute a few derivatives when <m>x
      \neq 0</m>.
      <md>
        <mrow>f^{(0)}(x) \amp = e^{x^{-2}}</mrow>
        <mrow>f^{(1)}(x) \amp = 2x^{-3}e^{-x^{-2}}</mrow>
        <mrow>f^{(2)}(x) \amp = \left(4x^{-6}-6x^{-4}\right)e^{-x^{-2}}</mrow>
        </md>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you can see the calculations are already getting a little complicated and we<rsq/>ve only taken the second derivative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conceptually, it is not difficult to compute these derivatives
      using the tools you learned in Calculus but the formulas involved
      do become complicated rather quickly.  Some care must be taken to
      avoid error.

      To streamline things a bit we take <m>y= x^{-1}</m>,
      and define <m>p_2(x) = 4x^6-6x^4</m> so that
      <me>
        f^{(2)}(x) = p_2(x^{-1})e^{-x^{-2}} = p_2(y)e^{-y^2}
        </me>.

      This example showed that while it was fruitful to exploit Taylor
      series representations of various functions, basing the
      foundations of Calculus on power series was not a sound idea.
    </p>

    <p>
      While Lagrange<rsq/>s approach wasn't totally successful, it was
      a major step away from infinitesimals and toward the modern
      approach.  We still use aspects of it today.  For instance we
      still use his prime notation to denote the derivative.
    </p>

    <p>
      Turning Lagrange<rsq/>s idea on its head it is clear that if we
      know how to compute derivatives, we can use this <q>machine</q>
      to obtain a power series when we are not clever enough to obtain
      the series by other (typically shorter) means.  For example,
      consider Newton<rsq/>s binomial series when
      <m>\alpha=\frac{1}{2}</m>.  Originally, we obtained this series
      by extending the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents.
      Taylor<rsq/>s formula provides a more systematic procedure. First we compute the derivatives of <m>f</m> at zero:
      <md>
        <mrow>f(x)\amp =(1+x)^{\frac{1}{2}};\amp f(0)\amp =1</mrow>
        <mrow>f^\prime(x)\amp =\frac{1}{2}(1+x)^{\frac{1}{2}-1};\amp  f^\prime(0)\amp =\frac{1}{2}</mrow>
        <mrow>f^{\prime\prime}(x)\amp =\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}-1\right)(1+x)^{\frac{1}{2}-2}\amp f^{\prime\prime}(0)\amp =\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}-1\right)</mrow>
      </md>
      and in general since
      <md>
        <mrow>f^{(n)}(x)\amp =\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}-1\right)\cdots\left(\frac{1}{2}-(n-1)\right)(1+x)^{\frac{1}{2}-n}</mrow>
        <intertext>we have</intertext>
        <mrow>f^{(n)}(0)\amp =\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}-1\right)\cdots\left(\frac{1}{2}-(n-1)\right)</mrow>
        </md>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next we substitute  <m>f^{(n)}(0)</m> into  Taylor<rsq/>s formula to obtain the series

      <md>
        <mrow>
          \sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n \amp{}= 1+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}-1\right)\cdots\left( \frac{1}{2}-(n-1)\right)}{n!}x^n
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp{}= 1+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\prod_{j=0}^{n-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}-j\right)}{n!}x^n
        </mrow>

      </md>

      As you can see, Taylor<rsq/>s <q>machine</q> will produce the
      power series for a function (if it has one), but is tedious to
      perform.  We will find, generally, that this tediousness can be
      an obstacle to understanding.  In many cases it will be better,
      or at least quicker, to be clever if we can.  However, it is
      comforting to have Taylor<rsq/>s formula available as a last
      resort.

  <section  xml:id="PowerSeriesQuestions-SeriesAnomalies">
    <title>Series Anomalies</title>
    <p>
      Until we began this chapter our approach to series mirrored that
      of the eighteenth century mathematicians. By exploiting the
      ideas of Calculus and power series they ingeniously derived
      mathematical results which were virtually unobtainable before.
      Mathematicans were eager to push these techniques as far as they
      could to obtain their results and they often showed good
      intuition regarding what was mathematically acceptable and what
      was not.  However, as the envelope was pushed further and
      further, substantial questions about the validity of their
      methods surfaced.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an illustration consider the series expansion
      <me>
        \frac{1}{1+x}=1-x+x^2-x^3+\cdots
        </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we substitute <m>x=1</m> into this equation, we obtain
      <me>
        \frac{1}{2}=1-1+1-1+\cdots
        </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we group the terms as follows <m>(1-1)+(1-1)+\cdots</m>, the
      series would equal <m>0</m>.  A regrouping of
      <m>1+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+\cdots</m> provides an answer of <m>1</m>.
      This violation of the associative law of addition did not escape
      the mathematicians of the 1700s.  In his 1760 paper <pubtitle>On
      Divergent Series</pubtitle> Euler said:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <idx><h>Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm</h></idx>

        Notable enough, however are the controversies over the series
        <m>1-1+1-1+\text{etc}</m>, whose sum was given by Leibniz as
        <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>, although others disagree . . .
        Understanding of this question is to be sought in the word
        <q>sum;</q> this idea, if thus conceived <mdash/> namely, the sum of a
        series is said to be that quantity to which it is brought closer
        as more terms of a series are taken <mdash/> has relevance only for the
        convergent series, and we should in general give up this idea of
        sum for divergent series.  On the other hand, as series in
        analysis arise from the expansion of fractions or irrational
        quantities or even of transcendentals, it will, in turn, be
        permissible in calculation to substitute in place of such series
        that quantity out of whose development it is produced.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Even with this formal approach to series, an interesting question
      arises.  The series for the antiderivative of <m>\frac{1}{1+x}</m>
      does converge for <m>x=1</m> while this one does not.
      Specifically, one antiderivative of the above series is
      <me>
        \ln(1+x)=x-\frac{1}{2}x^2+\frac{1}{3}x^3-\cdots
        </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we substitute <m>x=1</m> into this series, we obtain <m>\ln
      2=1-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}-\cdots</m>.  It is not hard to see
      that such an alternating series converges.  The following picture
      shows why.  In this diagram, <m>S_n</m> denotes the partial sum
      <m>1-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}-\cdots+\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the diagram we can see
      <m>S_2\leq S_4\leq S_6\leq\cdots\leq\cdots\leq S_5\leq S_3\leq S_1</m> and <m>S_{2k+1}-S_{2k}=\frac{1}{2k+1}</m>.
      It seems that the sequence of partial sums will converge to whatever is in the <q>middle.</q>
      Our diagram indicates that it is ln <m>2</m> in the middle but actually this is not obvious.
      Nonetheless it is interesting that one series converges for <m>x=1</m> but the other does not.

    <p>
      These examples illustrate something even more perplexing.  As
      we<rsq/>ve observed the divergent infinite sum
      <m>1-1+1-1+\cdots</m> does not appear satisfy the associative law
      for addition. Since the sum diverges (is meaningless) this is not
      too surprising.  On the other hand while the convergent series
      <m>1-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}-\cdots</m> does satisfy the
      associative law as expected, it does not satisfy the
      commutative law.  In fact, <xref ref="thm_rearrangements"></xref>
      shows that it fails to be commutative rather spectacularly.

      <men xml:id="EQUATIONHarmonicSeries">
        \sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n}=1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots
        </men>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even though the individual terms in this series converge to <m>0</m>,
      the series still diverges
      (to infinity)
      as evidenced by the inequality
      <md>
        <mrow>\left(1+\frac{1}{2}\right)\amp +\left(\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{6}+ \frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{8}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{9}+\cdots+\frac{1}{16}\right)+\cdots</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp >\frac{1}{2}+\left(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{8}+ \frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{16}+\cdots+\frac{1}{16}\right)+\cdots</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =   \infty</mrow>
        </md>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Armed with this fact,
      we can see why <xref ref="thm_rearrangements"></xref> is true.
      First note that
      <me>
        -\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{6}-\cdots=-\frac{1}{2}(1+\frac{1}{2}+ \frac{1}{3}+\cdots)=-\infty
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        1+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}+\cdots\geq\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{6}+\ldots= \infty
        </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This says that if we add enough terms of
      <m>-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{6}-\cdots</m> we can make
      such a sum as large as we wish (and negative) and if we add
      enough terms of <m>1+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}+\cdots</m> we can
      make such a sum as large as we wish (and positive).  Those facts 
      provide us with the general outline of the proof.  The trick is
      to add just enough positive terms until the sum is just greater
      than <m>a</m>.  Then we start to add on negative terms until the
      sum is just less than <m>a</m>.  Picking up where we left off
      with the positive terms, we add on just enough positive terms
      until we are just above <m>a</m> again.  We then add on negative
      terms until we are below <m>a</m>.  In essence, we are bouncing
      back and forth around <m>a</m>.  If we do this carefully, then
      we can get this rearrangement to converge to <m>a</m>.  The
      notation in the proof below gets a bit hairy, but keep this
      general idea in mind as you read through it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>O_1</m> be the first odd integer such that <m>1+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}+\cdots+\frac{1}{O_1}>a</m>.
      Now choose <m>E_1</m> to be the first even integer such that
      <me>
        -\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{6}-\cdots-\frac{1}{E_1} \lt a-\left(1+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}+\cdots+\frac{1}{O_1}\right)
        </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus
      <me>
        1+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}+\cdots+\frac{1}{O_1}-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{6}-\cdots-\frac{1}{E_1}\lt a
        </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that we still have <m>\frac{1}{O_1+2}+\frac{1}{O_1+4}+\cdots=\infty</m>.
      With this in mind, choose <m>O_2</m> to be the first odd integer with

      <md>

    <p>
      In a similar fashion choose <m>E_2</m> to be the first even integer such that

    <p>
      It is fun to know that we can rearrange some series to make them
      add up to anything we like but there is a more fundamental idea
      at play here.  That the negative terms of the Alternating
      Harmonic Series diverge to negative infinity and the positive
      terms diverge to positive infinity make the convergence of the
      alternating series very special.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider what happens when we sum the series.  We start with
      <m>1</m>. This is a positive term so our sum is starting to
      increase without bound.  Next we add <m>-1/2</m> which is a
      negative terms so our sum has turned around and is now starting
      to decrease without bound.  Then another positive term is added:
      increasing without bound.  Then another negative term:
      decreasing.  And so on.  The convergence of the alternating
      Harmonic Series is the result of a delicate balance between a
      tendency to run off to positive infinity and back to negative
      infinity.  When viewed in this light it is not really too
      surprising that rearranging the terms can destroy this delicate
      balance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Naturally, the alternating Harmonic Series is not the only such series.
      Any such series is said to <term>converge conditionally</term>
      <mdash /> the condition being the specific arrangement of the terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      To stir the pot a bit more, some series do satisfy the
      commutative property.  More specifically, one can show that any
      rearrangement of the series
      <m>1-\frac{1}{2^2}+\frac{1}{3^2}-\cdots</m> must converge to the
      same value as the original series (which happens to be
      <m>\int_{x=0}^1\frac{\text{ ln }
      (1+x)}{x}dx\approx.8224670334</m>).  Why does one series behave
      so nicely whereas the other does not?
    </p>

    <p>
      Issues such as these and, more generally, the validity of using
      the infinitely small and infinitely large certainly existed in the
      1700s, but they were overshadowed by the utility of the Calculus.
      Indeed, foundational questions raised by the above examples, while
      certainly interesting and of importance, did not significantly
      deter the exploitation of Calculus in studying physical phenomena.
      However, the envelope eventually was pushed to the point that not
      even the most practically oriented mathematician could avoid the
      foundational issues.
