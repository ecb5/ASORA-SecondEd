            While we have tried to tell the story of the development of
            Real Analysis as completely as possible, our overriding
            goal was always to teach mathematics, not history. Thus we
            have necessarily left the history incomplete.
          </p>
          <p>
            The interested student can fill in the gaps we have left by
            making use of the extensive resources that can be found at
            the <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/"

      The irony of this section is that it exists to tell you that this
      book was not written for you; it was written for your students.
      After all, we don't need to teach you about Real Analysis.  You
      already understand the subject.  The purpose of this text is to
      help your students make sense of the formal definitions, theorems,
      and proofs that they will encounter in your course.  We do this by
      immersing the student in the story of how what is usually called
      Calculus evolved into modern Real Analysis.  Our hope and
      intention is that this will help the student to appreciate why
      their intuitive understanding of topics encountered in Calculus
      needs to be replaced by the formalism of Real Analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
      The traditional approach to this topic (what we might call the
      <q>logical</q> story of Real Analysis), starts with a rigorous
      development of the real number system and uses this to provide
      rigorous definitions of limits, continuity, derivatives and
      integrals, and convergence of series; typically in that order.
      This is a perfectly legitimate story of Real Analysis and,
      logically, it makes the most sense.  Indeed, this is a view of the
      subject that every mathematician<ndash/>in<ndash/>training should eventually
      attain.  However, it is our contention that your students will
      appreciate the subject more, and hopefully retain it better, if
      they see how the subject developed from the intuitive notions of
      Leibniz, Newton and others in the seventeenth and eighteenth
      centuries to the more modern approach developed in the nineteenth
      and twentieth centuries.  After all, they are coming at it from a
      viewpoint very similar to that of the mathematicians of the
      seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  Our goal is to bring them
      into the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, mathematically
      speaking.
    </p>

    <p>
      We hasten to add that this is not a history of analysis book.  It
      is an introductory textbook on Real Analysis which uses the
      historical context of the subject to frame the concepts and to
      show why mathematicians felt the need to develop rigorous,
      non-intuitive definitions to replace their intuitive notions.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will notice that most of the problems are embedded in the
      chapters, rather than lumped together at the end of each chapter.
      This is done to provide a context for the problems which, for the
      most part, are presented on an as<ndash/>needed basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus the proofs of nearly all of the theorems appear as problems
      in the text.  Of course, it would be very unfair to ask most
      students at this level to prove, say, the Bolzano-Weierstrass
      Theorem without some sort of guidance.  So in each case we provide
      an outline of the proof and the subsequent problem will be to use
      the outline to develop a formal proof.  Proof outlines will become
      less detailed as the students progress.  We have found that this
      approach helps students develop their proof writing skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      We state in the text, and we encourage you to emphasize to your
      students, that often they will use the results of problems as
      tools in subsequent problems.  Trained mathematicians do this
      naturally, but it is our experience that this is still somewhat
      foreign to students who are accustomed to simply <q>getting the problem
      done and forgetting about it.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      The problems range from the fairly straightforward to the more
      challenging.  Some of them require the use of a computer algebra
      system (for example, to plot partial sums of a power series).
      These tend to occur earlier in the book where we encourage the
      students to use technology to explore the wonders of series.  A
      number of these problems can be done on a sufficiently advanced
      graphing calculator or even on Wolfram Alpha, so you should
      assure your students that they do not need to be super
      programmers to do this.  Of course, this is up to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      A testing strategy we have used successfully is to assign more
      time consuming problems as collected homework and to assign other
      problems as possible test questions.  Students could then be given
      some subset of these (verbatim) as an in-class test.  Not only
      does this make test creation more straightforward, but it allows
      the opportunity to ask questions that could not reasonably be
      asked otherwise in a timed setting.  Our experience is that this
      does not make the tests <q>too easy,</q> and there are worse
      things than having students study by working together on possible
      test questions beforehand.  If you are shocked by the idea of
      giving students all of the possible test questions ahead of time,
      think of how much (re)learning you did studying the list of
      possible questions you <em>knew</em> would be asked on a
      qualifying exam.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the end, use this book as you see fit.  We believe your
      students will find it readable, as it is intended to be, and we
      are confident that it will help them to make sense out of the
      rigorous, non-intuitive definitions and theorems of Real Analysis
      and help them to develop their proof-writing skills.
