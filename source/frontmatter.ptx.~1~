            While we have tried to tell the story of the development of
            Real Analysis as completely as possible, our overriding
            goal was always to teach mathematics, not history. Thus we
            have necessarily left the history incomplete.
          </p>
          <p>
            The interested student can fill in the gaps we have left by
            making use of the extensive resources that can be found at
            the <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/"
            visual="mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk"> MacTutor</url>

          </p>
          <p>
            All of the portraits of mathematicians used in this text
            have been taken from MacTutor.
